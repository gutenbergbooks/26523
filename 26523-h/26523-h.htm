<p><i>Dear Jessica</i>:</p>
<p><i>For a little while like shadows we have
played our parts on a shadowy stage, aping
the passions and follies of actual life. And
now, as the kind authors who gave us being
withdraw their support and leave us to fade
away into nothingness, the doubt arises
whether our little comedy was not all in
vain. I do not know. A wise poet of the
real world once said that man&#8217;s life was
merely</i> the dream of a shadow, <i>yet somehow
men persuade themselves that their own
pursuits are greatly serious. Was our life
any less than that, and were not our hopes
and sorrows and tremulous joy as full of
meaning to us as theirs to the creatures who
strut upon the stage of the world? Again
I say, I do not know: Only I am troubled
that so fair an image as yours should prove
after all a dream, a shadow&#8217;s dream, and
melt so swiftly away</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>New York</span>, April 20, 19&mdash;.</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Miss Doane</span>:</p>
<p>You will permit me to address you with
this semblance of familiarity, I trust, for the
frankness of our conversation in my office
gives me some right to claim you as an acquaintance.
And first of all let me tell you
that we shall be glad to print your review
of <i>The Kentons</i>, and shall be pleased to
send you a long succession of novels for
analysis if you can always use the scalpel
with such atrocious cunning as in this case.
I say atrocious cunning, for really you have
treated Mr. Howells with a touch of that
genial &#8220;process of vivisection&#8221; to which
it pleases him to subject the lively creatures
of his own brain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Howells,&#8221; you say, &#8220;is singularly
gifted in taking to pieces the spiritual machinery
of unimpeachable ladies and gentlemen&#8221;;
and really you have made of the
author one of the good people of his own
book! That is a malicious revenge for his
&#8220;tedious accuracy,&#8221; is it not? And you
dare to speak of his &#8220;hypnotic power of
illusion which is so essentially a freak element
in his mode of expression that even
in portraying the tubby, good-natured,
elderly gentleman in this story he refines
upon his vitals and sensibilities until the
wretched victim becomes a sort of cataleptic.&#8221;
Now that is a &#8220;human unfairness&#8221;
from a critic whom the most ungallant editor
would be constrained to call fair!</p>
<p>I forget that I am asked to sit as adviser
to you in a question of great moment.
But be assured neither you nor your perplexing
query has really slipped from my
memory. Often while I sit at my desk in
this dingy room with the sodden uproar of
Printing House Square besieging my one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
barricadoed window, I recall the eagerness
of your appeal to me as to one experienced
in these matters: &#8220;Can you encourage me
to give my life to literature?&#8221; Indeed, my
brave votaress, there is something that disturbs
me in the directness of that question,
something ominous in those words, <i>give
my life</i>. Literature is a despised goddess
in these days to receive such devotion.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Naked and poor thou goest, Philosophy,</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>as Petrarch wrote, and as we may say of
Literature. If you ask me whether it will
pay you to employ the superfluities of your
cleverness in writing reviews and sketches
and stories,&mdash;why, certainly, do so by all
means. I have no fear of your ultimate
success in money and in the laughing honours
of society. But if you mean literature
in any sober sense of the word, God forbid
that I should encourage the giving of your
young life to such a consuming passion.
Happiness and success in the pursuit of any
ideal can only come to one who dwells in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
sympathetic atmosphere. Do you think a
people that lauds Mr. Spinster as a great
novelist and Mr. Perchance as a great critic
can have any knowledge of that deity you
would follow, or any sympathy for the
follower?</p>
<p>It has been my business to know many
writers and readers of books. I have in all
my experience met just four men who have
given themselves to literature. One of these
four lives in Cambridge, one is a hermit in
the mountains, one teaches school in Nebraska,
and one is an impecunious clerk in
New York. They are each as isolated in
the world as was ever an anchorite of the
Thebaid; they have accomplished nothing,
and are utterly unrecognised; they are,
apart from the lonely solace of study, the
unhappiest men of my acquaintance. The
love of literature is a jealous passion, a self-abnegation
as distinct from the mere pleasure
of clever reading and clever writing as the
religion of Pascal was distinct from the
decorous worship of Versailles. The solitude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
of self-acknowledged failure is the
sure penalty for pursuing an ideal out of
harmony with the life about us. I speak
bitterly; I feel as if an apology were due
for such earnestness in writing to one who
is, after all, practically a stranger to me.</p>
<p>Forgive my naïve zeal; but I remember
that you spoke to me on the subject with
a note of restrained emotion which flatters
me into thinking I may not be misunderstood.
And, to seek pardon for this personal
tone by an added personality, it
distresses me to imagine a life like yours,
with which the world must deal bountifully
in mere gratitude for the joy it takes from
you,&mdash;to imagine a life like yours, I say,
sacrificed to any such grim Moloch. Write,
and win applause for gay cleverness, but
do not consider literature seriously. Above
all, write me a word to assure me I have
not given offence by this very uneditorial
outburst of rhetoric.</p>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Morningtown, Georgia</span>, April 27, 19&mdash;.</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>Since my return home I have thought
earnestly of my visit to New York. That
was the first time I was ever far beyond
the community boundaries of some Methodist
church in Georgia. I think I mentioned
to you that my father is an itinerant
preacher. But for one brief day I was a
small and insignificant part of the life in
your great city, unnoted and unclassified.
And you cannot know what that sensation
means, if you were not brought up as a
whole big unit in some small village. The
sense of irresponsibility was delightful. I
felt as if I had escaped through the buckle
of my father&#8217;s creed and for once was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
happy maverick soul in the world at large,
with no prayer-meeting responsibilities. I
could have danced and glorified God on a
curbstone, if such a manifestation of heathen
spirituality would not have been unseemly.</p>
<p>But the chief event of that sensational
day was my visit to you. Of course you
cannot know how formidable the literary
editor of a great newspaper appears to a
friendless young writer. And from our
brief correspondence I had already pictured
you grim and elderly, with huge black
brows bunched together as if your eyes
were ready to spring upon me miserable.
I even thought of adding a white beard,&mdash;you
do use long graybeard words sometimes,
and naturally I had associated them
with your chin. You can imagine, then,
my relief as I entered your office, with the
last legs of my courage tottering, and beheld
you, not in the least ferocious in appearance,
and not even <i>old</i>! The revulsion
from my fears and anxieties was so swift
and complete that, you will remember, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
gave both hands in salutation, and had I
possessed a miraculous third, you should
have had that also.</p>
<p>I am so pleased to have you confirm my
judgment of Howells&#8217;s novel; and that I
am to have more books for review. I
doubt, however, if Mr. Howells will ever
reap the benefit of my criticisms, for not
long since I read a note from him saying
that he never looked into <i>The Gazette</i>.
You must already have given offence by
doubting his literary infallibility.</p>
<p>But on the whole you question the wisdom
of my ambition to &#8220;give my life to
literature.&#8221; As to that I am inclined to
follow Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler&#8217;s opinion:
&#8220;Writing is like flirting,&mdash;if you can&#8217;t
do it, nobody can teach you; and if you
can do it, nobody can keep you from doing
it.&#8221; With a certain literary aspirant I know,
writing is even more like flirting than that,&mdash;an
artful folly with literature which will
never rise to the dignity of a wedding sacrifice.
She could no more give herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
seriously to the demands of such a profession
than a Southern mockingbird can take
a serious view of music. He makes it
quite independently of mind, gets his inspiration
from the fairies, steals his notes,
and dedicates the whole earth to the sky
every morning with a green-tree ballad,
utterly frivolous. Such a performance, my
dear Mr. Towers, can never be termed a
&#8220;sacrifice&#8221;; rather it is the wings and tail
of humour expressed in a song. But who
shall say the dear little wag has no vocation
because his small feather-soul is expressed
by a minuet instead of an anthem?</p>
<p>Therefore do not turn your editorial back
upon me because I am incapable of the more
earnest sacrifice. Even if I only chirrup a
green-tree ballad, I shall need a chorister to
aid me in winning those &#8220;laughing honours
of society.&#8221; And your supervision is all
the more necessary, since, as you said to
me, I live in a section where the literary
point of view is more sentimental than accurate.
This is accounted for, not by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
lack of native wit, but by the fact that we
have no scholarship or purely intellectual
foundations. We are romanticists, but not
students in life or art. We make no great
distinctions between ideality and reality
because with us existence itself is one long
cheerful delusion. Now, while I suffer
from these limitations more or less, my ignorance
is not invincible, and I could learn
much by disagreeing with you! Your letters
would be antidotal, and thus, by a
sort of mental allopathy, beneficial.</p>

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Miss Doane</span>:</p>
<p>There can be no doubt of it. Your reply,
which I should have acknowledged sooner,
gives substance to the self-reproach that
came to me the moment my letter to you
was out of my hands. All my friends
complain that they can get nothing from
me but &#8220;journalistic correspondence&#8221;; and
now when once I lay aside the hurry and
constraint of the editorial desk to respond
to what seemed a personal demand in a new
acquaintance, I quite lose myself and launch
out into a lyrical disquisition which really
applies more to my own experience than
to yours. Will you not overlook this fault
of egotism? Indeed I cannot quite promise
that, if you receive many letters from me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
in the course of your reviewing, you may
not have to make allowances more than
once for a note of acrid personality, or egotism,
if you please, welling up through the
decorum of my editorial advisings. &#8220;If
we shut nature out of the door, she will
come in at the window,&#8221; is an old saying,
and it holds good of newspaper doors and
windows, as you see.</p>
<p>But really, what I had in mind, or should
have had in mind, was not the vague question
whether you should &#8220;sacrifice your
life to literature,&#8221;&mdash;that question you very
properly answered in a tone of bantering
sarcasm; but whether you should sacrifice
your present manner of life to come and
seek your fortune in this &#8220;literary metropolis&#8221;&mdash;Heaven
save the mark! Let me
say flatly, if I have not already said it, there
is no literature in New York. There are
millions of books manufactured here, and
millions of them sold; but of literature the
city has no sense&mdash;or has indeed only contempt.
Some day I may try to explain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
what I mean by this sharp distinction between
the making of books, or even the
love of books, and the genuine aspiration
of literature. The distinction is as real to
my mind&mdash;has proved as lamentably real in
my actual experience&mdash;as that conceived in
the Middle Ages between the life of a <i>religiosus</i>,
Thomas à Kempis, let us say, and
of a faithful man of the world. But this is
a mystery, and I will not trouble you with
mysteries or personal experiences. You
would write as your Southern mockingbird
sings his &#8220;green-tree ballad&#8221;; the thought
of that bird mewed in a city cage and
taught to perform by rote and not for spontaneous
joy, troubled me not a little. I am
sending you by express several books....<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Miss Doane</span>:</p>
<p>I have said such harsh things about our
present-day makers of books that I am going
to send you, by way of palliative, a
couple of volumes by living writers who
really have some notion of literature. One
is Brownell&#8217;s <i>Victorian Prose Masters</i>, and
the other is Santayana&#8217;s <i>Poetry and Religion</i>.
If they give you as much pleasure
as they have given me, I know I shall win
your gratitude, which I much desire. It is
a little disheartening and a justification of
my pessimism that neither of these men
has received anything like the same general
recognition as our fluent Mr. Perchance,
that interpreter of literature to the American
<i>bourgeoisie</i>. I will slip in also a volume
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
or two of Matthew Arnold, as a good
touchstone to try them on. Now that you
are becoming a professional weigher of
books yourself, you ought to be acquainted
with these gentlemen.

<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>JESSICA TO PHILIP</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>Do not reproach yourself for having written
me a &#8220;journalistic&#8221; letter. I always
think of an editor as having only ink-bottle
insides, ever ready to turn winged
fancies into printed matter, or to enter upon
a &#8220;lyrical disquisition&#8221; concerning them.
Your distinction consists in a disposition
to abandon the formalities of the editorial
desk that you may &#8220;respond to the personal
demands of a new acquaintance.&#8221;
And this humane amiability leads me to
make a naïve confession. There are some
people whose demands are always personal.
I think it is their limitation, resulting
from a state of naturalness, more or less
primitive, out of which they have not yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
evolved. They do not appeal to your
judgment or wisdom or even to your sympathy,
but to <i>you</i>. Their very spirits are
composed of a sort of sunflower dust that
settles everywhere. And if they have
what we term the higher life at all, it is expressed
by a woodland call to some tree-top
spirit in you. Thus, here am I, really
desirous of an abstract, artistic training of
the mind, already taking liberties with the
sacred corners of your editorial dignity by
impressing <i>personal</i> demands.</p>
<p>And just so am I related to the whole
of life,&mdash;even to the &#8220;publicans&#8221; in my
father&#8217;s congregation. Indeed, if the desire
&#8220;to eat with sinners&#8221; insured salvation,
there would be less cause for alarm about
my miraculous future state. The attraction,
you understand, depends not upon the
fact of their being sinners, but upon the
sincerity of their mortality. The more unassumingly
these reprobates live in their share
of the common flesh, far below spiritual pretences,
the more does my wayward mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
tip the scales of unregenerate humour in
their direction. My instincts hobnob with
their dust. But do not infer that I have
identified you with these undisciplined
characters. When I was a child, out of the
rancour of a well-tutored Southern imagination
I honestly believed that every man the
other side of Mason and Dixon&#8217;s line had a
blue complexion, thin legs, and a long tail.
And once when I was still very young, as I
hurried from school through a lonely wood,
I actually <i>saw</i> one of these monsters quite
plainly. And I thought I observed that
his tail was slightly forked at the end! I
have long since forgiven you these terrifying
caudal appendages, of course, but, for
all that, I keep a wary eye upon my heavenly
bodies and at least one wing stretched
even unto this day when my guardian
angel introduces a Northern man. My
patriotic instincts recommend at once the
wisdom of strategy. And it is well the
&#8220;personal demands&#8221; come from me to
you; for, had the direction been reversed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
by this time I should have sought refuge
somewhere in my last ditch and run up a
little tattered flag of rebellion to signify the
state of my mind.</p>
<p>It is just as well that you advise me
against trying my fortunes in your &#8220;literary
metropolis.&#8221; My father is set with all his
scriptures against the idea. &#8220;Strait is the
gate and narrow is the way that leads to
eternal life&#8221;; and, having predestined me
for a deaconess in his church, he is firmly
convinced that the strait and narrow way
for me does not lie in the direction of New
York. However, I have already whispered
to my confidential hole-in-the-ground that
nothing but the extremity of old-maid desperation
will ever induce me to accept the
vocation of a deaconess. Thus do a man&#8217;s
children play hide and seek with the beam
in his eye while he practises upon the mote
in theirs! But if, some day when the heavens
are doubtful between sun and rain, you
espy a little ruffled rainbow, propelled by
a goose-quill pen, coquetting northward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
with the retiring clouds, know that &#8217;tis the
spirit of Jessica Doane arched for another
outing in your literary regions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you amaze me with the
charge that &#8220;of literature the city has no
sense, or indeed only contempt,&#8221; and I
await the promised explanation with interest.
For my own part, I often wonder
if there will remain any opportunities for
literary intelligence to expand at all when
the happy (?) faculty of man&#8217;s ingenuity
has devastated all nature&#8217;s countenance and
resources with &#8220;improvements,&#8221; cut down
all the trees to make houses of, and turned
all the green waterways into horse-power
for machinery. Then we shall have cotton-mill
epics, phonograph elegies from
the tops of tall buildings; and then ragtime
music, which interprets that divine art only
for vulgar heels and toes, will take the place
of anthems and great operas.</p>
<p>The books have come, and among them
is another lady&#8217;s literary effort to make a
garden. <i>Judith</i> it is this time, following
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
hard upon the sunburned heels of <i>Elizabeth,
Evelina</i>, and I do not know how
many more hairpin gardeners. Why does
not some man with a real spade and hoe
give his experience in a sure-enough
garden? I am wearied of these little
freckled-beauty diggers who use the same
vocabulary to describe roses and lilies that
they do in discussing evening toilets and
millinery creations.

<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>JESSICA TO PHILIP</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>We have had a visitor, Professor M&mdash;&mdash;,
the doctor of English literature in E&mdash;&mdash;
College, which you will remember is not
very far from Morningtown. He came to
examine a few first editions father has of
some old English classics&mdash;(I have neglected
to tell you that this is father&#8217;s one carnal
indulgence, dead books printed in funny
hunchbacked type!). He is a young man,
but so bewhiskered that his face suggests a
hermit intelligence staring at life through
his own wilderness. His voice is pitched
to a Browning tenor tone, and I have good
reasons for believing that he is a bachelor.</p>
<p>Still we had some talk together, and that
is how I came to practise a deceit upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
you. Seeing a copy of <i>The Gazette</i> lying
on the table this morning, Professor M&mdash;&mdash;
was reminded to say that there was a
&#8220;strong man,&#8221; Philip Towers by name,
connected with that paper now. I cocked
my head at once like a starling listening to
a new tune, for that was the first time I had
heard your name praised by a literary man
in the South. He went on to say that he
had been delighted with your last book, <i>Milton
and His Generation</i>, and asked if I had
observed your work in the literary department
of <i>The Gazette</i>. I admitted demurely
that I had. He praised several reviews (all
written by me!) particularly, and said that
you were the only critic in America now
who was telling the truth about modern
fiction. Then he incensed me with this
final comment:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand how he does this
newspaper work so forcefully, almost savagely,
and is at the same time capable of
writing such delicate, scholarly essays as
this volume contains!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen Mr. Towers,&#8221; I remarked,
mentally determining that you should suffer
for that distinction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! what manner of man is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His dust has congealed, stiffened into
a sort of plaster-of-Paris exterior, and he
has what I call a <i>disinterred</i> intelligence!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man whose very personality is a
kind of mental reservation, and whose intelligence
has been resurrected up through
the thought and philosophy of three thousand
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&mdash;&mdash; looked awkward but impressed.</p>
<p>And I hoped he would ask how you actually
looked, for I was in the mood to give
a perfectly God-fearing description of you.</p>
<p>But from the foregoing you will see that
I am capable of sharing your literary glory
on the sly, and without compunction. Indeed,
the false rôle created in me a perverse
mood. And I entered into a literary discussion
with M&mdash;&mdash; that outraged his pedantic
soul. It was my way of perjuring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
his judgment, in return for his unwitting
approval of my reviews. Besides, the
assumption of infallibility by dull, scholarly
men who have neither imagination nor
genius has always amused me. And this
one danced now as frantically as if he had
unintentionally grasped a live wire that hurt
and burned, but would not let go! Finally
I said very engagingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor M&mdash;&mdash;, I hope to improve in
these matters by taking a course of instruction
under you next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now God forbid that you should ever
do such a thing, Miss Doane! I would
sooner have you thrust dynamite under the
chair of English Literature, than see you in
one of my classes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus am I cast upon the barren primer
commons of this cold world! And that
reminds me to say that I have been reading
the essays by Arnold and Brownell which
you gave me, with no little animosity.
Brownell&#8217;s criticism of Thackeray is very
suggestive, and brushes away a deal of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
trash that has been written about his lack
of artistic method. But I never supposed
such loose sentences would be characteristic
of so acute a critic. They do not stick
together naturally, but merely logically.
And I am sure you would not tolerate them
from me. But of all the books you have given
me I like best George Santayana&#8217;s
<i>Poetry and Religion</i>. Who is he anyhow?
It may be a disgraceful admission to make,
but I never heard of him before. His name
is foreign, and his style is not American.
For when an American says a daring thing,
particularly of religion, he says it impudently,
with a vulgar bravado. But this
man writes out his opinion coolly, simply,
with that fine hauteur that will not condescend
to know of opposition. I think that
is admirable. Arnold&#8217;s courtesy and satirical
temperance in dealing with what he
discredits is a pose by the side of this
man&#8217;s mental grace and courage. And you
know how we usually denominate style:
it is the little lace-frilled petticoat of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
lady novelist&#8217;s mincing passions, or the
breeches that belong to a male author&#8217;s
mental respirations. But with this man,
style is a spirit sword which cleaves between
delusions and facts, which separates
religion from reality and establishes it in
our upper consciousness of ideality.</p>
<p>Is it not absurd for such a barbarian as I
am to discuss these gospel-makers of literature
with you? But it is much more remarkable
that one or any of them should
excite my admiration and respect. Really,
if you must know it, Mr. Towers, this is
where I grow humble-minded in your presence.
I am fascinated with your ability to
deal with the usually indefinable, the esoteric
side of art,&mdash;the esoteric side of life
by interpretation. And here I discover a
shadowy, ghostly likeness between you and
this George Santayana. You do not think
toward the same ends, or write in the same
style, but you <i>know</i> things alike, as if you
had both drunk from the same Eastern
fountain of mysteries.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>And now I am about to change my gratitude
into indignation. For I begin to
suspect that you sent me these books to
inculcate the doctrine of literary humility.
If so, you have succeeded beyond your
highest expectations. Until now, writing
has been a series of desperate experiments
with me. I progressed by inspiration. But
these fellows&mdash;Arnold especially&mdash;discredit
all such performances. And he does it
with the air of an English gentleman inspecting
a naked cannibal. He makes my
flesh creep! He regards an inspiration as
a sort of vulgarity that must be dressed
and stretched before it can be used. From
his point of view I infer that he considers
genius as a dangerous kind of drunkenness
that fascinates the world, but is really closely
related to bad form in literature. On the
other hand, father says that if Matthew
Arnold had known of me he would have
purchased me, placed me in a cage with a
fountain pen, and exhibited me to his
classes at Oxford as a literary freak!

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Miss Doane:</span></p>
<p>I will remember your amused hostility to
&#8220;hairpin gardeners&#8221; and see that no more
out-of-door books come to you until I have
one with a stimulating odour of burning
cornstalks and rotting cabbages. Meanwhile
let me assure you that your reviews
of <i>Elizabeth, Evelina, Judith</i>, and their sisters
have been none the less delightful for a
vein of wicked impatience running through
them. The books I am now sending....</p>
<p>You ought not to be amazed at my
dismal comments on latter-day literature.
The fact is, you have dissected our present
book-makers better than I could do it myself,
for the reason that I am too amiable
(I presume, you see, that I have the wit)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
to judge my fellow-workers with such
merciless veracity.</p>
<p>But I have just read an article in the
<i>Popular Science Monthly</i> which throws an
unexpected light on the subject. The paper
is by Dr. Minot and is a biologist&#8217;s comment
on &#8220;The Problem of Consciousness.&#8221;
You might not suppose that an argument
to show how &#8220;the function of consciousness
is to dislocate in time the reactions
from sensations&#8221; (!) would have much to do
with the properties of literature, but it has.
Let me copy out some of his words, as
probably you have not seen the magazine:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;The communication between individuals is especially
characteristic of vertebrates, and in the higher members
of that subkingdom it plays a very great rôle in aiding
the work of consciousness. In man, owing to articulate
speech, the factor of communication has acquired a
maximum importance. The value of language, our
principal medium of communication, lies in its aiding
the adjustment of the individual and the race to external
reality. Human evolution is the continuation of animal
evolution, and in both the dominant factor has been the
increase of the resources available for consciousness.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Now that sounds pretty well for a scientist.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
It should seem to follow that literature,
being, so to speak, the permanent
mode of communication,&mdash;conveying ideas
and emotions not merely from man to man,
but from generation to generation,&mdash;is the
predominant means by which this development
of consciousness is attained. It is a
pretty support we derive from the enemy.
But mark the serpent in the grass&mdash;&#8220;the
adjustment of the individual and the race
to external reality.&#8221; The real aim of evolution
is purely external, the adjustment of
man to environment; consciousness has
value in so far as it promotes this adjustment.
Flatly, to me, this is pure nonsense,
a putting of the cart before the horse, a
vulgar <i>hysteron-proteron</i>, none the less execrable
because it is the working principle
not of a single man, but of the whole of
soctety to-day. Consciousness, I hold, is
the supremely valuable thing, and progress,
evolution, civilisation, etc., are only significant
in so far as they afford nourishment to
it. Literature is the self-sufficient fruit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
this consciousness, I say; the world says it
is a mere means of promoting our physical
adjustment. You see I take up lightly the
huge enmity of the world.</p>
<p>This is wild stuff to put into a journalistic
letter, no doubt. If I were writing a treatise
I would undertake to show that this difference
of view in regard to consciousness
and physical adjustment is the oldest and
most serious debate of human intelligence.
Saint Catharine, Thomas à Kempis, and
all those religious fanatics who counted the
world well lost, made a god of consciousness
and thought very little of physical adjustment.
The debate in their day was an
equal one. To-day it is all on one side&mdash;and
<i>væ victis</i>! I cry out&mdash;why should I
not?&mdash;as one of the conquered, and I am
charitable enough to advise another not to
enter the combat. It is a poor consolation
to wrap yourself in your virtue, mount a
little pedestal, set your hand on your heart,
and spout with Lucan: <i>The winning cause
for the gods, but the vanquished for me</i>!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
Sometimes we begin to wonder whether,
after all, the world may not be right, and
at that moment the wind begins to blow
pretty chill through our virtue.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Miss Doane</span>:</p>
<p>Is my suspicion right? Was my last
letter to you really a tangle of crude ideas?
That has grown to be my way, until I begin
to wonder whether the horrid noises of
Park Row may not have thrown my mind
a little out of balance. For my strength
lay in silence and solitude. It is hard for
me to establish any sufficient bond between
my intellectual life and my personal relationships,
and as a consequence my letters,
when they cease to be mere journalistic
memoranda, float out into a sea of unrestrained
revery.</p>
<p>Yet I would ask you to be patient with
me in this matter. From the first, even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
before I saw you here in New York, I felt
that somehow you might, by mere patience
and indulgence, if you would, re-establish
the lost bond in my life; that somehow the
shadow of your personality was fitted to
move among the shadows of my intellectual
world. What a strange compliment to
send a young woman!&mdash;for compliment it
seems in my eyes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as some explanation of this
intellectual twilight into which I would so
generously introduce you, I am sending
you a little book I wrote and foolishly
printed several years ago on the quiet
life of the Hindus. The mood of the book
still returns to me at times, though I have
cast away its philosophy as impracticable.
I look for peace in the way that Plato
trod, and some day I shall write my palinode
in that spirit. Let me, in this connection,
copy out a few verses I wrote
last night and the night before. It is my
first digression into poetry since I was a
boy:

<p>Many thanks for this copy of your book,
<i>The Forest Philosophers of India</i>. I have
just finished reading it, and now I understand
you better. Your sense of reality
has been destroyed by this mysticism of
the East. The normal man has a more
materialistic consciousness. But having
lost that, your very spirit has dissolved
into these strange illuminations which you
call thought, but which I fear are only
the ghostly rays of a Nirvana intelligence.
With you life is but a breath without form,
a whisper out of your long eternity. And
I confess that to me the impression of a
man not being at home in his own body
is nothing short of terrifying.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>You were not expecting so fierce a criticism
of your own book from one of your
own reviewers, I suspect. Ah, but your
&#8220;Three Commands&#8221; have laid me under a
spell. I cannot say anything about them
without saying too much; and I am a little
rebellious.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>I have not replied earlier to your letter
on the problem of consciousness, because
I was waiting to read Dr. Minot&#8217;s article.
At last I got hold of the magazine, and so
far from finding your comments &#8220;a tangle
of crude ideas,&#8221; they have even proved
suggestive&mdash;perhaps not in the way you
expected. For following your line of
thought, I wondered if it could have been
some violent death-rate among our own
species that has produced that desperate
phenomenon, the literary consciousness of
the historical novelist I have been reviewing
for you. And, come to think of it, I do not
know any other class of people whose problem
of consciousness could be so readily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
reduced to a &#8220;bionomical&#8221; platitude. They
all write for the same slaying purpose.
Did you ever observe how few of their
characters survive the ordeals of art?
Usually it is the long-lost heroine, and the
hero, &#8220;wounded unto death&#8221; however,
and one has the impression that even these
would not have lived so long but for the
necessity of the final page.</p>
<p>But I must not fail to tell you of a dramatic
episode in connection with my first
venture into the realm of biological thought.
<i>The Popular Science Monthly</i> has long been
proscribed at the parsonage on account of
its heretical tendencies. And my purpose
was to keep a profound secret the fact that
I had purchased a copy containing Minot&#8217;s
article. But some demon prompted me to
inquire of my father the meaning of the
term &#8220;epiphenomenon.&#8221; Now a long association
with the idea of omniscience has
rendered him wiser in consciousness than
in fact, which is a joke the imagination
often plays upon serious people. But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
could neither give a definition nor find the
word in his ancient Webster. This dictionary
is his only unquestioned authority
outside the Holy Scriptures, and he declines
to accept any word not vouched for by this
venerable authority. Therefore he reasoned
that &#8220;epiphenomenon&#8221; had been built up
to accommodate some modern theory of
thought, some new leprosy of the mind
never dreamed of by the noble lexicographer.
And so, fixing me with a pair of
accusing glasses, he inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter, where did you see this
remarkable word?&#8221;</p>
<p>I do not question that I am a direct descendant
from my fictitious grandmother,
Eve! I am always being tempted by apples
of information, and I have often known
the mortifying sensation of wishing to hide
my guilty countenance in my more modern
petticoat on that account.</p>
<p>He read the &#8220;blasphemous&#8221; article
through, only pausing to point out heresies
and perversions of the sacred truth as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
went along. But when he reached the
sentence in which the author calmly asserts
the theory of monism, he actually gagged
with indignation: &#8220;My child, do you know
that this godless wretch claims that the
same principle of life which makes the cabbage
also vitalises man?&#8221; I looked horrified,
but I could barely restrain my
laughter; for, indeed, there are &#8220;flat-dutch&#8221;-headed
gentlemen in his congregation
who might as well have come up at
the end of a cabbage stalk for all the thinking
they do. But I need not tell you that
the magazine containing the profane treatise
on consciousness was burned, while a
livid picture was drawn of my own future
if I persisted in stealing forbidden fruit from
this particular tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>But your last letter put me into a more
serious frame of mind. And I <i>am</i> complimented
that you entertain the hope that
I may be of assistance in re-establishing
the lost bond between you and real life.
But do you know that you have appealed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
to the missionary instincts of a barbarian?
The attributes of patience and indulgence
do not belong to natures like mine. Never
has any affliction worked out patience in
me, never has my strongest affection taken
the form of indulgence. In me Love and
Friendship, Sorrow and Gladness, take
fiercer forms of expression.</p>
<p>But I will not conceal from you the fact
that from the first I have felt in our relationship
a curious sensation of magic in
one opposed to mystery in the other. I
have felt the abandon and madness of a
happy dancer, whirling around the dim
edge of your shadow-land in the wild
expectation of beholding the disembodied
spirit of you come forth to join me. It is
not that I <i>wished</i> to work a charm, but
the shadow of your mysterious life draws
me into the opposition of a counter-influence.
The gift of power is not in me to
set foot across the magic line into the dim
land of your soul, any more than I could
dissolve into a breath of moonlit air, or a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
wave of the sea. For, in you, I seem to
perceive some strange phenomenon of a
spirit changed to twilight gloom which
covers all your hills and valleys with the
mournful shadow of approaching night.
Often this conception appalls me, but more
frequently I conceive a wild energy from
the idea, as of one sent to rim the shadows
in close and closer till some star shall shine
down and bless them into heroic form and
substance. And I have been amazed to
find within my mind a witch&#8217;s charm for
working rainbow miracles upon your dim
sky,&mdash;but so it is. There have always
been mad moments in my life when I have
felt all-powerful, as if I had got hold of the
ribbon ends of an incantation! This is
another one of my limitations at which
you must not laugh. For a juggler must
be taken seriously, or he juggles in vain;
he must have an opportunity to create the
necessary illusion in you to insure the success
of his performance. Meanwhile, I go
to make the circle of my dance smaller;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
who knows but to-morrow I may be a
snow-bunting on your tall cliffs, or a little
homeless wren seeking shelter in your
valley.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Miss Doane</span>:</p>
<p>So I am a disembodied ghost in your
estimation, and you, &#8220;happy dancer,&#8221; are
whirling around the rim of my shadow-land
with some sweet incantation learned
in your Georgia woods to conjure me out
into the visible world. Really I would call
that a delicious bit of impertinence were I
not afraid the word might be taken in the
wrong sense.</p>
<p>And yet, I must confess it, there is too
much truth in what you say. Some day,
when I am bolder, I may unfold to you the
whole story of my ruin&mdash;for it is a ruin to
be disembodied, is it not? I may even
indicate the single phrase, the mysterious
word of all mysteries, that might evoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
the spirit from the past and incarnate him
in the living present. Do not try to guess
the phrase, I beseech you, for it would
frighten you now and so I should lose my
one chance of reincarnation. When I visit
you in the South, some day soon, I will
tell you the magic word I have learned.</p>
<p>What hocus-pocus I must seem to be
talking, as if there were some cheap
tragedy in my life. Indeed there is nothing
of the sort. I have lived as tamely as a
house-cat, my only escapade having been
an innocent attempt at playing Timon for
a couple of years. The drama of my life
has been a mere battling with shadows.
Your relation of the effect produced in
your home by Dr. Minot&#8217;s heresies carries
me back to the first act in that shadow
fight, for I too was brought up by the
strictest of parents, and, indeed, was myself,
as a boy, a veritable prodigy of piety.
What would you think of me as a preacher
expounding the gospel over a piano-stool
for pulpit to a rapt congregation of three?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
I could show you a sermon of that precocious
Mr. Pound-text printed in the New
York <i>Observer</i> when he was as much as
nine years old&mdash;and the sermon might be
worse.</p>
<p>I can recall these facts readily enough;
but the battle of doubt and faith that I
passed through a few years later I can no
more realise than I can now realise your
father&#8217;s blessed assurance of heaven. I
know vaguely that it was a time of unspeakable
agony for me, a rending asunder,
as it were, of soul and body. The doctrine
was bred into my bones; I saw the folly
of it intellectually, but the emotional comfort
of it was the very quintessence of my
life. The struggle came upon me alone
and I was without help or guidance. Into
those few years of boyish vacillation, I see
now that the whole tragedy of more than
a century of human experience was thrust.
One day I sat in church listening to a
sermon of appealing eloquence: &#8220;And
this is the condemnation, that light is come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
into the world, and men loved darkness
rather than light, because their deeds were
evil.&#8221; Was I too deliberately turning my
back on the light? I hid my face and
cried. That was the end. I came out of
the church free, but I had suffered too
much. Something passed from my life
that day which nothing can replace; for
perfect faith, like love, comes to a man but
once.</p>
<p>1 was empty of comfort and without
resting-place for my spirit. Then said I:
Look you, belief in this religion as dogma
is gone; why not hold fast to its imaginative
beauty! If revelation is a fraud, at
least the intricacies of this catholic faith
have grown up from the long yearning of
the human heart, and possess this inner
reality of corresponding with our spiritual
needs. And for several years I wrought
at Christian symbolism, trying to build up
for my soul a home of poetical faith so to
speak. But in the end this could not
satisfy me; I knew that I was cherishing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
a sham, a pretty make-believe after the
manner of children. Better the blindness
of true religion than this illusion of the
imagination. And I was now a grown
man.</p>
<p>Then by some inner guidance I turned
to India. How shall I tell you what I
found in the philosophies of that land!
One thing will surprise you. Instead of
pessimism I found in India during a certain
period of time a happiness, an exultation
of happiness, such as the world to-day
cannot even imagine. And I found that
this happiness sprang from no pretended
revelation but from a profound understanding
of the heart. Do this, said the books,
and you will feel thus, and so step by step
to the consummation of ecstasy. I read
and was amazed; I understood and knew
that I too, if my will were strong, might
slip from bondage and be blessed. But
I saw further that the path lay away from
this world, that I must renounce every
desire which I had learned to call good,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
that I must strip my soul naked of all this
civilisation which we have woven in a
loom of three thousand years. The dying
command of Buddha terrified me: &#8220;All
things pass away; work out your own
salvation diligently!&#8221; The words were
spoken to comfort and strengthen the
bereaved disciples, but to me they sounded
as an imprecation, so different is the training
of our society from theirs. The loneliness
and austerity of the command appalled
me; I would not take the first step, and
turned back to seek the beautiful things of
the eye.</p>
<p>And now at last I am caught up in the
illusion of a new Western ideal&mdash;not
Christianity, for that has passed away,
strange as such a statement may sound
to you in your orthodox home, but yet
a legacy of Christ. Thou shalt love God
with all thy heart and thy neighbour as
thyself, was the law of Christianity. We
have forgotten God and the responsibility
of the individual soul to its own divinity;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
we have made a fetish of our neighbour&#8217;s
earthly welfare. We are not Christians
but humanitarians, followers of a maimed
and materialistic faith. This is the ideal
of the world to-day, and from it I see but
one door of escape&mdash;and none but a strong
man shall open that door.</p>
<p>So I look at the world and life, but, even
as I write, something like a foreboding
shudder comes over me. I think of your
home and your father and the straitness
of the law under which you live, and I
wonder whether after all the ghost of that
fierce theology is yet laid. Can it be that
this law which darkened my boyhood shall
arise again and claim the joy of my maturer
years?</p>
<p>Alas, you who venture to trip so gayly
about the rim of my shadow-land with
your brave incantations, behold what spirit
of gloom and malignant mutterings you
have evoked from the night. I have written
more than I meant&mdash;too much, I fear.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>An evangelist has been here this week.
He fell upon us like a howling dervish who
had fed fanaticisms on locusts and wild
honey. And he has stirred up the spiritual
dust of this community by showing an intimacy
with God&#8217;s plans in regard to us
very disconcerting to credulously minded
sinners. As for me, I have passed this
primer-state of religious emotion. I am
sure a kind God made me, and so I belong
to Him, good or bad. In any case I cannot
change the whole spiritual economy of
Heaven with my poor prayers and confessions.
I try to think of my shortcomings,
therefore, as merely the incidents of an
eternal growth. I shall outlive them all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
in the course of time, quite naturally, perennially,
as the trees outlive the blight of
winter and put forth each year a new
greenness of aspiring leaves. I dare not
say that I know God, and I will not believe
some doctrines taught concerning Him; but
I keep within the principle of life and follow
as best I can the natural order of things.
And for the most part I feel as logically related
to the divine order as the flowers are
to the seasons. I know that if this really is
His world,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 4.04709345106696em;'>should the chosen guide</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Be nothing better than a wandering cloud,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>I cannot miss my way.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Are you shocked, dear Shadow, at such
a creed of sun and dust?&mdash;you, a dishoused
soul, wandering like a vagrant ghost along
life&#8217;s green edge? After all, I doubt if I am
so far behind you in spiritual experience.
The difference is, I have two heavens, that
orthodox one of my imagination, and this
real heaven-earth of which I am so nearly a
part. But you have forced the doors of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
mystery and escaped before your time.
And you can never return to the old dust-and-daisy
communion with nature, yet you
are appalled at the loneliness and the terrible
sacrifices made by a man in your situation.
Your spiritual ambition has outstripped your
courage. You are an adventurer, rather
than an earnest pilgrim to Mecca.</p>
<p>And yet day after day as I have weathered
farther and farther back in the church,
like a little white boat with all my sails
reefed to meet the gospel storm of damnation
that has been raging from the pulpit, I
have thought of you and your Indian philosophy,
by way of contrast, almost as a
haven of refuge. Our religion seems to me
to have almost the limitations of personality.
There can be no other disciples but Christian
disciples. Our ethics are bounded by
doctrines and dogmas. But, whether Buddhist
or Christian, the final test of initiation
is always the same&mdash;&#8220;All things pass away,
work out your own salvation with diligence,&#8221;
&#8220;Die to the world,&#8221; &#8220;Present
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
your bodies a living sacrifice&#8221;&mdash;and you
would not make these final renunciations.
You &#8220;turned back to seek the beautiful
things of the eye.&#8221; Well, if one is only
wise enough to know what the really
beautiful things are, it is as good a way as
any to spin up to God. Meanwhile, I
doubt if that &#8220;Western ideal,&#8221; the kind-hearted
naturalism which &#8220;makes a fetish
of our neighbour&#8217;s welfare,&#8221; will hold you
long. Already you &#8220;see one door&#8221; of
escape. I wonder into what starry desert
of heaven it leads.</p>
<p>Do you know, I cannot rid myself of the
notion that yours is an enchanted spirit,
always seeking doors of escape; but at the
moment of exit the wild wings that might
have borne you out fail. Some earth spell
casts you back, incarnate once more. A
little duodecimal of fairy love divides the
desires of your heart and draws one wing
down. &#8220;The beautiful things of the eye,&#8221;
that is your little personal footnote, O
stranger, which clings like a sweet prophecy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
to all your asceticism and philosophy. And
prophecies cannot be evaded. They must
be fulfilled. They are predestined sentences
which shape our doom, quite independently
of our prayers I sometimes think,&mdash;like the
lily that determined to be a reed, and
wished itself tall enough, only to be
crowned at last with a white flag of
blooms.</p>
<p>And do not expect me to pray you
through these open ways of escape. I
only watch them to wish you may never
win through. Something has changed me
and set my heart to a new tune. I must
have already made my escape, for it seems
to me that I am on the point of becoming
immortal. As I pass along the world, I
am Joy tapping the earth with happy heels.
I am gifted all at once with I do not know
what magic, so that all my days are changed
to heaven. And almost I could start a
resurrection of &#8220;beautiful things&#8221; only to
see you so glad. But that will never be.
There are always your wings to be reckoned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
with; and with them you are ever
ready to answer the voices you hear calling
you from the night heavens, from the temples
and tombs of the East.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw a woman sitting far
back in the shadows of the church wearing
such a look of sadness that she frightened
me. It was not goodness but sorrow that
had spiritualised her face. And to me she
seemed a wan prisoner looking through the
windows of her cell, despairing, like one
who already knows his death sentence.
&#8220;What if after all I am mistaken,&#8221; I thought,
&#8220;and there really is occasion for such grief
as that!&#8221; I could think of nothing but
that white mystery of sorrow piercing the
gloom with mournful eyes. And when at
last the &#8220;penitents&#8221; came crowding the
altar with quaking cowardly knees, I fell
upon mine and prayed: &#8220;Dear Lord, I am
Thine, I will be good! Only take not from
me the joy of living here in the green valleys
of this present world!&#8221; Was such
a prayer more selfish than the sobbing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
petitions of the penitents there about the
church-rail, asking for heavenly peace? I
have peace already, the ancient peace of
the forests as sweet as the breath of God.
I ask for no more.</p>
<p>You see, dear &#8220;Spirit of gloom,&#8221; that
I have sent you all my little scriptures in
return for your &#8220;malignant mutterings.&#8221;
My God is a pastoral Divinity, while yours
is a terrible Mystery, hidden behind systems
of philosophy, vanishing before Eastern
mysticism into an insensate Nirvana, revealing
ways of escape too awful to contemplate.
I could not survive the thoughts
of such a God for my own. I am <i>His</i>
heathen. By the way, did you ever think
what an unmanageable estate that is&mdash;&#8220;And
I will give you the heathen for your
inheritance&#8221;?

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Miss Doane</span>:</p>
<p>What mental blindness led me to give
you such a book? What demon of perversity
tempted you to send me such a
review of Miss Addams&#8217;s Hull-House heresies?
You know my abhorrence of our
&#8220;kind-hearted materialism&#8221; (so you call
it), yet you calmly write me a long panegyric
on this last outbreak of humanitarian
unrighteousness&mdash;unrighteousness, I
say, vaunting materialism, undisciplined
feminism, everything that denotes moral
deliquescence. Of course I see the good,
even the wise, things that are in the book,
but why didn&#8217;t you expose the serpent
that lurks under the flowers?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, what is good in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
book is old, what is bad is new. Do you
suppose that this love of humanity which
has practically grown into the religion of
men,&mdash;do you suppose that this was not
known to the world before? The necessity
of union and social adhesion was
seen clearly enough in the Middle Ages.
The notion that morality, in its lower
working at least, is dependent on a man&#8217;s
relation to the community, was the basis
of Aristotle&#8217;s Ethics, who made of it a
catchword with his <i>politikon zôon</i> (your
father will translate it for you as &#8220;a political
animal&#8221;). The &#8220;social compunction&#8221;
is as ancient as the heart of man. How
could we live peacefully in the world
without it? Literature has reflected its
existence in a thousand different ways.
Here and there it will be found touched
with that sense of universal pity which
we look upon as a peculiar mark of its
present manifestation. In that most perfect
of all Latin passages does not Virgil
call his countryman blessed because he is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
not tortured by beholding the poverty of
the city&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 12.1412803532009em;'>neque ille</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Aut doluit miserans inopem, aut invidit habenti?</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And is not the <i>Æneid</i> surcharged with
pitying love for mankind, &#8220;the sense of
tears in mortal things&#8221;? So the life and
words of St. Francis of Assisi are full of
the breath of brotherly love&mdash;not brotherhood
with all men merely, but with the
swallows and the coneys, the flowers, and
even the inanimate things of nature. And
the letters of St. Catherine of Siena are
aflame with passionate love of suffering men.</p>
<p>But there is something deplorably new
in these more modern books, something
which makes of humanitarianism a cloak
for what is most lax and materialistic in the
age. I mean their false emphasis, their
neglect of the individual soul&#8217;s responsibility
to itself, their setting up of human love
in a shrine where hitherto we worshipped
the image of God, their limiting of morality
and religion to altruism. I deny flatly that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
&#8220;Democracy ... affords a rule of living
as well as a test of faith,&#8221; as Miss Addams
says; I deny that &#8220;to attain individual
morality in an age demanding social morality,
to pride one&#8217;s self on the results of
personal effort when the time demands
social adjustment, is utterly to fail to apprehend
the situation&#8221;; I say we do <i>not</i>
&#8220;know, at last, that we can only discover
truth by rational and democratic interest in
life.&#8221; Why did you quote these sentences
with approval? There is no distinction
between individual and social morality, or,
if there is, the order is quite the other way.
All this democratic sympathy and social
hysteria is merely the rumour in the lower
rooms of our existence. Still to-day, as
always, in the upper chamber, looking out
on the sky, dwells the solitary soul, concerned
with herself and her God. She
passes down now and again into the noise
and constant coming and going of the
lower rooms to speak a word of encouragement
or admonition, but she returns soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
to her own silence and her own contemplation.
(The heart of a St. Anthony in the
desert of Egypt, the heart of many a lonely
Hindu sage knows a divine joy of communication
of which Hull House with its
human sympathies has no conception.) Morality
is the soul&#8217;s debt to herself.</p>
<p>It is a striking and significant fact that
these humanitarians are continually breaking
the simplest rules of honesty and decent
living. Rousseau, the father of them
all, sending his children (the children of
his body, I mean) to the foundling asylum,
is a notorious example of this; and John
Howard is another. I have in my own
experience found these people impossible
to live with.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this tendency to forget
the common laws of personal integrity
by allusion to a novel which comes from
another college-settlement source. It is a
story called, I think, <i>The Burden of Christopher</i>,
published three or four years ago,&mdash;a
clever book withal and rather well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
written. The plot is simple. A young
man, just from his university, inherits a
shoe factory which, being imbued with
college-settlement sentimentalism, he attempts
to operate in accordance with the
new religion. Business is dull and he is
hard-pressed by competitive houses. An
old lady has placed her little fortune in his
hands to be held in trust for her. To prevent
the closing down of his factory and
the consequent distress of his people, he
appropriates this trust money for his business.
In the end he fails, the crash comes,
and, as I recollect it, he commits suicide.
All well and good; but in a paragraph
toward the end of the book, indeed by the
whole trend of the story, we discover that
the humanitarian sympathy which led the
hero to sacrifice his individual integrity for
the weal of his work-people is a higher
law in the author&#8217;s estimation than the old
moral sense which would have made his
personal integrity of the first importance to
himself and to the world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>I submit to you, my dear reviewer, that
such notions are subversive of right thinking
and are in fact the poisonous fruit of an
era which has relaxed its hold on any ideal
outside of material well-being. For that
reason when I read in Miss Addams&#8217;s book
such words as these, &#8220;Evil does not shock
us as it once did,&#8221; I am filled with anger.
I wonder at the blindness of the age when
I read further such a perversion of truth as
this: &#8220;We have learned since that time to
measure by other standards, and have ceased
to accord to the money-earning capacity
exclusive respect.&#8221;&mdash;Have we?

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Miss Doane</span>:</p>
<p>I am troubled lest the letter I wrote yesterday
should have seemed to breathe more
of personal bitterness than of philosophic
judgment. Did I make clear that my hostility
to modern humanitarianism is not due
to any contempt for charity or for the desire
of universal justice? I dislike and distrust
it for its false emphasis and for its
perversion of morality&mdash;and the two faults
are practically one.</p>
<p>Last night I was reading in <i>Piers Plowman</i>
and came upon a passage which exactly
illustrates what I mean. The old Monk of
Malvern might be called the very fountainhead
in English letters of that stream
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
of human brotherhood which has at last
spread out into the stagnant pool of humanitarianism.
He wrote when the rebellion
of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw was fermenting,
when the people were beginning to
cry out for their rights, and his vision is
instinct with the finest spirit of love for the
downtrodden and the humble. Yet never
once does his compassion or indignation
lead him to neglect spiritual things for
material. Let me copy out a few of his

<p>Imagine, if you can, such a speech in the
precincts of Hull House! I am not concerned
to exalt poverty, I know how much
suffering it creates in the world; and yet I
say that an age to which poverty is only a
degradation without any possible spiritual
compensation, is an age of materialism. I
wish I might follow the use of the word
<i>comfort</i> from its early nobility as you see it
here down to its modern degeneracy, where
it signifies the mere satisfaction of the body.
The history of that word would be an eloquent
sermon. Have I made myself clear?
Do you understand what I mean by the
false emphasis of our humanitarianism?
And do you see why I could not stomach
your review of Miss Addams&#8217;s book?&mdash;I am
sending by express several novels, among
them....

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>Here in the South we are born into our
traditions and we generally die by them.
We never encourage the mental extravagance
of adding new dimensions to our
minds. When you have had an hour&#8217;s
conversation with any of us, or have exchanged
three letters, you can be comfortably
sure of what we think on any subject
under the sun. Thus, you see, I was
wholly unprepared for the point of view
expressed in your last two letters. I
thought you were a gentle disciple,&mdash;following
the lights behind us indeed; but I
did not suspect that you were bent upon
this journey through the dust of centuries
with the temper of a modern savage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>However, it seems a man must have
either ass&#8217;s ears or a cloven foot; and, soon
or late, most of us expect to find our hero
in Bottom&#8217;s predicament. But I would
rather have acknowledged the beam in my
own eye than have discovered this diabolical
split in your heel. All my life I have
been familiar with the inhumanity of the
merely spiritually minded. And I think it
was because your own spirit was not denominational,
nor fitted to any dogma of
my acquaintance, that I trusted it. But
really, the product is always the same.
And I begin to wonder if there is not
something fundamentally cruel in the law
that governs soul-life. No matter what the
age or the colour of the doctrine is, those
most highly developed in this way generally
show a <i>conscientious selfishness</i> that
is dehumanising. They have no tender
sense of touch, their relation to the world
about them is obtuse; and for this reason,
I think, they excite aversion in normally
minded people.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>I leave you, my dear sir, to &#8220;expose the
serpent lurking under the flowers.&#8221; For
my part, I believe humanitarianism is the
better part of any religion. And while my
knowledge of social orders does not reach
so far back into the grave-dust of the past,
I am unwilling to agree with you that it is
&#8220;coeval with human nature.&#8221; But it is
one of the ends toward which all religions
must tend,&mdash;for if a man love not his
brother whom he hath seen, how can he
love God whom he hath not seen?&mdash;But I
forget! Love is not essential to your sort
of Nirvana mysticism. In you, spirituality
is a sort of cruel aspiration toward personal
perfection. Still, that little scripture represents
the advance made by this modern
religion of Christianity over your Hindu
theosophy.</p>
<p>Do you know I think a man&#8217;s religious
philosophy ought to fit him particularly for
his present environment of earth and flesh.
One cannot tell so much about the life after
death. It may be necessary to make us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
over in the twinkling of an eye, and even
to change the very direction of all spirit life
in us. But here, we know accurately what
the needs are; and any sort of wisdom that
fails to provide us with the right way
of dealing with one another is defective.
Thus your Buddhism seems to me more
mesmeric than satisfying. It is a way men
have of murdering themselves, while continuing
to live, into peace and oblivion.
There is a surrender, a negation of life, a
denial of total responsibilities, or human
obligations, which to my mind indicates a
monstrous selfishness, none the less real
because its manifestations are passive and
dignified by a philosophic pose. You see
I am reading your last two letters by the
light of certain earlier confessions.</p>
<p>And again I do not think you can fairly
complain of humanitarianism because in
some books &#8220;it is synonymous with all
that is lax and materialistic in the age.&#8221;
The author of a novel is never so concerned
to tell the truth as he is to exploit and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
illustrate an interesting theory. You have
no right to expect gospel from literary
mountebanks. Nor can you judge the integrity
of it by such disciples as Rousseau,
who was merely a decadent soul fascinated
by the contemplation of his own depravity.
The scriptures of such a Solomon, however
true in theory, are neither honest nor effective.
But as a final climax of your argument,
you declare that in your &#8220;own
experience&#8221; you have found these humanitarians
&#8220;impossible to live with.&#8221; I do
not wonder at that. A question far more
to the point is, Did they find <i>you</i> impossible
to live with? Come to think of it, I would
rather live with a humanitarian, myself,
even if his soul was carnally bow-legged.
But my sort of charity is so perverse, so
awry with humour, that the constant contemplation
of a man trying to wriggle out of
the flesh through some spiritual key-hole,
made by his own imagination, into a form
of existence much higher than agreeable,
would be, to say the least of it, diverting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>You copy several sentences from the
Hull-House book in your letter and cry to
me in an accusing voice to know why I
quoted them in my review &#8220;with approval.&#8221;
Suppose I did not comprehend
their important relation to the subject from
your point of view? But I do understand
enough to know that the &#8220;social compunction&#8221;
in Aristotle&#8217;s day was a mere theory,
a sublime doctrine practised by a few,
whereas now it is a great governing principle,
a dynamic power in the social order
of mankind. And I challenge your accuracy
in calling such social sympathy
&#8220;only a rumour in the lower rooms of our
existence.&#8221; My notion is that the choir
voice of it has already reached that grand
third story of yours, and that the &#8220;solitary
soul&#8221; in the &#8220;upper chamber&#8221; will presently
find herself along with other traditions&mdash;in
the attic! Oh, I know your sort!
You stay in your upper chamber as long
as atmospheric conditions make it comfortable.
But before this time I have known
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
you to sneak down into those same &#8220;lower
rooms&#8221; to warm yourself by humanitarian
hearthstones. And that you are not nearly
so immortal as you think you are is proved
by these winter chills along the spine.
There come occasions when you get tired
of your own stars and long to feel the thrill
of that royal life-blood that leaps like a
ruby river of love through the grimy, toiling,
battling humanitarian world beneath
you. Did you once intimate to me that if
ever I conjured you out of the shadows
which seem to surround you, I should be
horrified at the vision? Well, I am!

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Miss Doane</span>:</p>
<p>So your servant has a cloven hoof and
just escapes the adornment of ass&#8217;s ears!
Dear, dear, what a temper! But, jesting
aside, you must not suppose I abhor the
cant of humanitarianism from any thin-blooded
selfishness or outworn apathy.
Have I not made this clear to you? It is
the negative side of humanitarianism (the
word itself is an offence!), and not its portion
of human love that vexes my soul.</p>
<p>Through one of the crooked streets not
far from Park Row that wind out from
under the grim arches of the Brooklyn
Bridge, I often pass on business. Here on
the step at the entrance to a noisome court,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
where heaven knows how many families
huddle together behind the walls of these
monstrous printing-houses, there sits day after
day a child, a little pale, peaked boy, who
seems to belong to no one and to have
nothing to do&mdash;sits staring out into the
filthy street with silent, wistful eyes. There
is only misery and endurance on his face,
with some wan reflection of strange dreams
smothered in his heart. He sits there,
waiting and watching, and no man knows
what world-old philosophy comforts his
weary brain. The face haunts me; I see it
at times in my working hours; it peers at
me often from the surging night-throngs of
upper Broadway; it passes dimly across my
vision before I fall asleep. It has become a
symbol to me of the long agony of human
history. Because I know the misery of
that face and the evil that has produced it,
because I know that misery has been in the
world from the beginning and shall endure
to the end, and because my heart is sickened
at the thought,&mdash;that is why I rebel so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
bitterly against a doctrine that turns away
from all spiritual consolation for some
vainly builded hope of a socialistic paradise
on this earth. I have heard one of these
humanitarians avow that he and practically
all his friends were materialists, and such
they are even when they will not admit it.
Dear girl, believe me, I have lived over in
my mind and suffered in my heart the long
toil and agony which the human race has
undergone in its effort to wrest some assurance
of spiritual joy and peace from
these clouds of illusion about us; I have read
and felt what the Hindu ascetic has written
of lonely conflict in the wilderness; I have
heard the Greek philosophers reason their
way to faith; I have comprehended the
ecstasy of the early Christians; I have taken
sides in the high warfare of mediæval realists
against the cheap victory of nominalism.
I know that the word of deliverance
has been spoken by all these and that it is
always the same word. And now come
these humanitarians, with their starved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
imaginations, who in practice, if not in
speech, deny all the spiritual insight of the
race and seek to lower the ideal of mankind
to their fools&#8217; commonwealth of comfort in
this world. Because I revolt from this false
and canting conception of brotherly love,
am I therefore devoted to &#8220;conscientious
selfishness&#8221;? Ah, I beg you to revise your
reading of this book of my heart, and to
remodel your criticism.</p>
<p>But I am saying not a word of what is
most in my thoughts. In two days I shall
set out for a trip to the South which will
bring me to Morningtown. Will you turn
away in horror if you see a wretched creature
hobbling with cloven hoof up the
scented lane of your village? For sweet
charity&#8217;s sake, for your own sweeter sake,
believe that his heart is full of love however
wrong his mind may be.</p>

<p>WRITTEN AFTER RETURNING FROM MORNINGTOWN</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Miss Doane</span>:</p>
<p>It is all different and the morning has
forgotten to return since I left you where
your village meets the great world. Have
you kept God&#8217;s common dayspring imprisoned
among your garden trees and
flowers? What shall I say? What shall I
not say? Only this, that I gave my happiness
into your hands and you have broken
it and let it drop to the ground. See what
a shipwreck I have suffered of all my
dreams. These long years of solitary reading
and study I have been gathering up
in my imagination the passions and joys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
and hopes of a thousand dead lovers,&mdash;the
longing of Menelaus for Helen, the outcry
of Catullus for Lesbia, the worship of
Dante for Beatrice&mdash;all these I have made
my own, believing that some day my love
of a woman should be rendered fair in her
eyes by these borrowed colours; and now I
have failed and lost; and what I would
give, you have accounted as light and insufficient.
Is there no speech left to tell
you all the truth? I am a little bewildered,
and have not been able to pluck up heart
of courage. Write me some word of familiar
consolation; do not quite shut the
door upon me until my eyes grow accustomed
to this darkness. All the light is
with you, and the beauty that God has
given the world, all the meaning of human
life,&mdash;and I turn my back on this and go
out into the night alone. Dear girl, I
would not utter a word of reproach. I
know that my love, which seemed to me
so good, may be as nothing to you, is indeed
not worthy of you, for you are more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
than all my dreams&mdash;and yet it was all that
I had. I shall learn perhaps to write to
you as a mere reviewer of books;&mdash;the
irony of it.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>Can you believe it? I was absurdly glad
to receive your letter this morning. Ever
since you went away I have felt so brave
and desolate&mdash;like a poor dryad who has
fought her way out of her own little kingdom
of love and peace and green silence,
for the sake of a foreign ideal which really
belongs to the world at large. (I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if I did become a deaconess after
all!) In my effort to escape a romantic
sacrifice to a strange heathen divinity, I
find myself offered upon this common altar
in the name of a theory, Humanitarianism.
My smoke arises. I have been consumed,
and now I write you merely in the spirit,&mdash;you
see I am learning <i>your</i> incantations.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>But being disembodied, I may at least be
truthful. Besides, it is sometimes wiser
to make long-distance confessions than to
tell the truth face to face. Then listen,
dear Heart, it was not Philip, but poor
Jessica who was vanquished that day as
we walked through the lanes and fields
around Morningtown. I do not know how
to tell you, but of a sudden I am becoming
learned in all the joys and griefs of
this world. There is a sweetheart reason
for them all, lying buried somewhere.
For love is nature&#8217;s vocation in us, I think.
We cannot escape it. Our vision is already
love-lit when the prince comes. All he
needs do is to step within the radiant
circle. Oh, my Heart, is it not terrible
when you think of it, that we may keep
our wills, but our hearts we cannot keep!
They go from us happy pilgrims, and
return unto us old and grey, sometimes
lost and forsaken.</p>
<p>You came so fast upon the heels of
your other letter that I did not have time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
to put on my shield and buckler before
you were here in the flesh, formidable,
real, cloven hoof and all! I was frightened
and militant,&mdash;frightened lest you should
win from me the freedom of my heart,
militant for the freedom of my will. Well,
at least I kept the latter, but I can tell you,
it is making a poor bagpipe tune of the
victory. When I went down to you that
first evening, it was like going to meet an
enemy, dear and terrible. I was divided
between two impulses, both equally savage
1 think, either to stab or to fall upon
your breast and weep. But you will bear
me witness that my greeting in reality was
conventionally awkward. In any case,
your eyes would have saved me. They
are wide and deep, and as you stood here
by the window where I am writing now,
with both my hands clasped in yours, I
saw a bright beam leap up far within them
like candles suddenly lighted in an open
grave. You had not come merely to make
peace with me, you had my capitulation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
ready, but I knew then I should never
sign. Let the dead bury their dead; as for
me, I am too much alive to die long and
amicably with any ghost of a philosopher
in the &#8220;upper chamber.&#8221; I do not even
belong in the &#8220;lower rooms,&#8221; but outside
under the skies of our ever green world.
I have already determined that if there is
nothing going on in heaven when I am
translated thither, I will ask to be changed
into a wreath of golden butterflies with
permission to follow spring round and
round the earth.</p>
<p>And that brings me to another part of
my confession. You are aware that I do
not really know <i>you</i>, only your mind. The
time I saw you in New York does not
count. For upon that occasion we only
ran an editorial handicap just to try each
other&#8217;s intellectual paces, did we not? But
when you ventured boldly down here upon
my own heath&mdash;oh! that was a different
matter. I meant to be as brave as a
Douglas in his hall. You should not ride
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
across my drawbridge and away again till
I knew <i>you</i>. Well, you know the dull
usual way of discovering what and who
a stranger is, by asking his opinions or
by classifying his face and expression
according to biological records. Now, a
man&#8217;s features are only his great-grand
somebody&#8217;s modified or intensified, and
his opinions, as in your case, may not
represent him but his mental fallacies. So
I invented a test of my own. I tried a
man by a jury of my trees, not your peers
exactly, but friends of mine who have
become to me strong standards of excellence
and virtue and repose in human
nature. Dear Enemy, I coaxed you into
my little heart-shaped forest, which you
remember lies like a big lover&#8217;s wreath on
the Morningtown road beyond my father&#8217;s
church. And behold! it was as if we had
come home together. We touched hands
with the green boughs in friendly greeting.
There was nothing to be said, no place
now for a difference between us. For the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
rights and wrongs of the world did not
reach beyond the shady rim of the silence
there. Goodness and fidelity was the
ground we trod upon, and we were native
to it. Yet it was the first time I ever
entered a little into sympathy with the
exalted cruelty of your spiritual nature.
For in the forest, ever present, is the intimation
of Nature&#8217;s indifference to pain.
There is no charity in a commonwealth
of trees. They live, decay, and die, and
there is no sign of compassion anywhere.
It is terrible, but there is a Spartan beauty
in the fact.</p>
<p>But suddenly, as we sat there in the
sweet green twilight, the thought pierced
me like a pang that after all you are more
nearly related to the life of the forest than
I am. I merely love it, but you are like it
in the cold, ruthless, upward aspiration of
your soul. I long for a word with the
trees, but you are so near and kin that
your silence is speech. And then I asked
myself this question: &#8220;What is the good,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
where is the wisdom in loving a tree man,
who may shelter you, but never can be
like you in life or love?&#8221; Always his
arms are stretched upward to the heavens
in a prayer to be nearer to the light. He
is a sort of divine savage who cannot
remember the earth heart that may love
and die beneath him like the leaves upon
the ground. Thus we came out of the
wood, you who are made so that you can
never really understand what you have
lost, and I, with all my will in my wings,
and stronger for the loss of my heart.
Some day, perhaps, if I keep the wings,
it will return, a little withered, but sound
as a brownie&#8217;s. Then, dear man of the
trees, I shall bury it here in the forest like
a precious seed. Who knows what it may
come to be, my poor heart that was dead
and shall live again,&mdash;a tall lady-tree as
heartless as any man-oak, or only a poor
vine!

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>Imagine if you can the moral perversity
of a young woman who never regrets a
witty deception or a graceful subterfuge,
but repents sometimes in sackcloth and
ashes for her truth-telling. I&#8217;d give half
my forest now to have back the letter I
sent you yesterday. But since I cannot
recall it, I wish you to bear in mind that
what was true of a woman&#8217;s heart yesterday,
to-day may be only a little breach of
sentiment with which to reproach her
prudence. We are never lastingly true.
The best you can expect is that we be
generally true to the mood we are in.</p>
<p>When you were here, I could not beguile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
you into a discussion of the subject upon
which we differ so widely. Pardon the
malicious reference, but it seemed to me
that you had closed the door of your
&#8220;upper chamber&#8221; and hastened down
here to confess your own reality. And
no challenge, however ingenious, could
provoke you into displaying the cloven
hoof of your &#8220;higher nature.&#8221; When my
father, for instance, who has long suspected
the soundness of your doctrines, laid down
one of his lurid hell-fire premises as an
active reason for seeking salvation, I observed
that you showed the agility of a
spiritual acrobat in avoiding the conflict.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I return to the point of
divergence between us. You are angry
with the humanitarians for their materialism.
But you forget who the Hull-House
classes are,&mdash;people so poor and starved
and cold that their very souls have perished.
You cannot teach your little goblin-faced

have fed and vitalised him, and stretched
his poor withered imagination across the
fair fields of youth&#8217;s summer years. Believe
me, the humanitarian&#8217;s calling seems
stupid from your point of view because
you are born five hundred years before
your time. When the Hull-House principles
have abolished the poor and the rich,
and have transplanted the whole human
race far and wide over the hills and valleys
of this earth, then will be time enough for
the spiritual luxury of such teachings as
yours.</p>
<p>The last batch of books has come, Creelman&#8217;s
novel, <i>Eagle Blood</i>, among them.
Evidently it is a story written to prove the
intellectual and commercial ascendency of
Americans over mere Anglo-Saxons. The
heroine and a few romantic details are
thrown in as a bait to the &#8220;average
reader.&#8221; Alas for the &#8220;average reader&#8221;!
How many crimes of this sort are committed
in his name! We can never hope
to have a worthy literature until he has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
been eliminated from the consciousness of
those who make it. In the days when
he was not to be reckoned with, and men
wrote for a very few appreciative admirers
and some desperately cruel critics, then
Carlyle began to swear at his &#8220;forty-million
fool,&#8221; and so attracted their attention,
and ever since we have had them
with us, forty-million average readers, calling
for excitement and amusement. It is
this same &#8220;forty-million fool&#8221; who has
made historical romances an inexhaustible
source of revenue to the writers of them.
For he is naïve, and has never suspected
the real dime-novel character of such fiction.
Can you not get some one to write
an article outlining a plan by which the
&#8220;average reader&#8221; may be abolished?

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Jessica</span>:</p>
<p>I will not for any consideration of custom
put such a breach between my dreams and
reality as to go on addressing you in the
old formal way. It will be idle to protest;
I have bought the privilege with a great
price; nay, I have even bought you, and
no outcry of your rebel will shall ever redeem
you from this bondage to my hopes.
One thing I know: there is no power in
all the world equal to love, and he who
has this power may win through every
opposition. And was ever a man in such
a position as mine? Others have been
compelled to overcome a prejudice against
what was base or unworthy in themselves,
but I am forced to defend myself for my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
best heritage of understanding. Would it
help me in your esteem if I flung away all
my hard-won philosophy and ranged myself
with the sentimentalists of the day?
I will not believe it. I will fight this upstart
folly while breath is in me, and I will
teach you to fight it with me. This morning
I took that poor book of Miss Addams&#8217;s
and, in place of what you sent me, wrote
such a review as will quite astound the
&#8220;forty-million fool&#8221; you so despise&mdash;we
agree there, at least. And all the while I
was writing, I kept saying to myself, How
will Jessica answer that? and, Will not
Jessica believe now that my hatred of humanitarianism
does not spring from selfishness
or contempt, but from sympathy for
mankind?</p>
<p>Yet if anything could bring me to hate
my brothers it would be this monstrous
certainty that my feeling towards them
stands in the way of the one supreme, all
consuming desire of my heart. I could
cry out in the words of the <i>Imitation</i>:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As often as I have gone among men, I
have returned less a man&#8221;; for their foolish
chatter has stolen from me the possession
without which we are dwarfed and marred
in our being. Your love is more to me
than all the hopes of men. You must
hearken to me. I have charged the winds
with my passion; the scent of flowers shall
tell you the sweetness of love; you shall
not walk among your beloved trees but
their whispering shall repeat the words
they heard me speak. I will wrap you
about with fancies and dreams and passionate
thoughts till no way of escape is left
you. You shall not read a book but some
word of mine shall come between your
eyes and the printed page. You shall not
hear a simple song but you shall remember
that music is the voice of love. You think
that I have no heart for the many and can
therefore have no heart for one. Dear girl,
my love is so great that it has made me
stronger a thousand times than you; there
is no escape for you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>As I passed the little goblin boy this
morning I dropped a coin in his hand and
said: &#8220;It is from a lady in Georgia who
loves you.&#8221; His face lighted up with surprise
at the words (not at the money, for I
have given him that before), and I was
glad to extend the benediction of your
sweetness a little further in the world. Believe
me, I am not so foolish as to despise
charity or true efforts to increase the comfort
of the poor; but I know that poverty
and pain and wretchedness can never be
driven from the world by any besom of the
law, and I do see that humanitarianism,
sprung as it is from materialism and sentimentalism
(what a demonic crew of <i>isms</i>!)
has bartered away the one valid consolation
of mankind for an impossible hope
that begets only discontent and mutual
hatred among men. They are the followers
of Simon Magus, these humanitarians;
they would buy the gifts of Heaven with a
price; and their creed is the real Simonism.
Have you ever read the <i>Imitation</i>, and do
you remember these verses?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>For though I alone possessed all the comforts of the
world and might enjoy all the delights thereof, yet it is
certain that they could endure but a little.</p>
<p>Wherefore, O my soul, thou canst not be fully comforted,
nor be perfectly refreshed, save in God, the comforter
of the poor and the helper of the humble.</p>
<p>Let temporal things be for use, but set thy desire on
the eternal.</p>
<p>Man draweth nearer to God so as he departeth further
from all earthly comfort.</p>
</div>
<p>You have taught me to love, dear Heart;
and now, as you see, you are teaching me
to be orthodox. Do not think I shall give
you up; there is only one power greater
than my desire, and that is Death. I would
not end with so ill-omened a word, but
rather with your own sweet name, Jessica.

<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>JESSICA TO PHILIP</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Father Confessor</span>:</p>
<p>You observe, I do not retaliate by addressing
you as Dear Philip. After reflecting,
I conclude that this would be an undue
concession to make, while the above title
removes you to a safer sphere. It limits
and qualifies your relationship and at the
same time affords me the happy advantage
of confessing my heart to you. Really, I
have always felt the need of such an officer
in my spiritual kingdom. I could never
reconcile myself to the incongruity of confessing
in our experience meetings. It
seemed to me that sharing my confidence
with so many people was heterodox to nature
itself. For this reason I have always
thought that while Protestantism is based
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
upon a nobler theory of the truth, Roman
Catholicism is founded upon a much
shrewder knowledge of human nature.</p>
<p>However, I do not come seeking absolution
for any sins. Such shortcomings as I
have are so personal, so really a part of dear
me, that I should scarcely be complete without
them. They are vixenish plagues of
character that distinguish me from more
conventional saints. But now that I have
willed myself away from you, I need no
longer conceal my heart. My love has
been shriven, and, like a little white ghost
out of heaven, must hark back to you
occasionally for a blessing.</p>
<p>To begin with, then, when your letter
came this morning, I took just a peep inside
to see if it was good, and then hurried
away to our forest to enjoy it, for I always
feel more at home with you there. And
although the season is so far advanced that
the whole earth is chilled and desolate, my
heart was like the springtide, swelling with
gladness. Joy reached to my vagabond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
heels, and I had much ado to maintain the
resignation gait of a minister&#8217;s daughter
through the village streets. And once out
of sight I kissed my hand quickly over my
shoulder till my face burned. For had you
not promised to attend me? &#8220;I will wrap
you about with fancies and dreams,&#8221; you
said. I was like a young-lady comet drawing
after me a luminous trail of love. I
began to comprehend the advantages of
my position, to rejoice in my sacrifice. I
caught the finer aspiration of love, like one
who lays down his life and finds it again
in nobler forms. Brave, good father, this
thing that you have revealed to me is like
a sweet eternity. It neither begins nor
ends: only we do that. When our time
comes we are swept into the current of it,
happy, predestined atoms, and afterwards
we are lost out of it like the leaves on the
trees. But love is like the wind in their
branches; it never is gone. So it seems
to me now when all my heart&#8217;s leaves are
stirred to gladness by the dear gale of love.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>But do not despise me, O sage in the
upper chamber, for my selfishness. I keep
far to the windward of you because I
was made for love, not for sacrifice. The
altar of your soul life is very fine, very
beautiful, but I am too much alive to be
offered up on such a table. Suppose I
trusted you, gave myself with my heart,
and in after years you should fall upon the
idea of expurgating all sensations, all heresies,
all affections from your life as the
Brahmins do, what then would become of
poor Jessica? I should sit upon your altar
like a withered fairy, casting dust over my
unhallowed head and calling down elfish
curses upon you. Ah me! when I come
upon a splendid man-statue that suddenly
glows into living heart and flesh, I may
wonder and love, but I should never trust
myself in the arms of that phenomenon,
lest, being clasped there, he should as
suddenly turn back to his native stone and
freeze the life in me!</p>
<p>Have you noticed that I tell you nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
of the village doings here, the little church
sociables and a thousand commonplace
details that go to make up the sum of
existence amid such surroundings? It is
because I do not really live among them.
My mind is alien to these narrow margins
of society and religion. But it is always
of the little forest that I tell you, as if that
were my real home, as indeed it is. And
it is the dearer to me now that we have
walked through it together. So in each
letter you may expect a report of how
things go there. This morning, as I looked
about at the sober ground covered thick
with dying leaves, I thought of what a
gallant display of autumnal colors we had
on that morning. Our little friends of the
summer time are flitting here and there
through the naked branches in silent confusion.
There are no green boughs behind
which to conceal their orchestral
moods. Besides, their inspiration is gone,
their singing hearts are benumbed by the
cold. But for your letter thrust somewhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
I could not have escaped the ghost
of sadness that seemed to haunt the earth
and sky. Suddenly, as I stood in the
midst of it all, a cardinal flashed like a red
spark into a tall pine, fluffed out his breast,
and swept the forest with a defiant note
of melody. It was a challenge to the long
winter time, a prophecy of spring and of
high green trees, and of a mate cloistered
now far away in the wilderness: &#8220;You
shall not hear a simple song, but you shall
remember that music is the voice of love,&#8221;
whispered the letter against my heart.
What a brave thing is life when we have
love and the hope of spring latent within
us! I admit, as I listened to the little red
troubadour of the pine, that, had you been
as near as the dreams and fancies that
wrapped me about, this fight in me for
freedom would have been at an end. Do
not trust these feeble moods of mine, however;
not one of them would last half the
length of time you would need to make the
journey from New York to Morningtown!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>So! you have written such a review
of Miss Addams&#8217;s book as will astonish the
&#8220;average reader,&#8221; and all the while you
wondered: &#8220;How will Jessica answer
that?&#8221; Abridged, this is her opinion:
That an editor should be careful how he
kicks his heels at the spirit of his age.
The world has an ancient and effective
way of dealing with such heroes.</p>
<p>No, I am not familiar with the <i>Imitation</i>.
But I gather from the passages you
quote that it is a spiritual exercise prepared
for those who &#8220;possess all the comforts
of this life,&#8221; and are weary enough
of them to pass on to the philosophy of
renunciation. But you should remember
that the Hull-House classes have not had
the necessary experience with comforts.
Renunciation is impossible for them, for
they have nothing to give up.</p>
<p>My love to the little goblin boy.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Jessica</span>:</p>
<p>Did ever &#8220;Father Confessor&#8221; have so
sweet and so wilful a sinner to shrive!
Your only sin is that you love me, and do
you think I shall grant absolution for that?
As I read your letter with its wayward confession,
it seemed to me indeed that I was
in some temple of the gods instead of this
book-littered den, and the rumble of the
street was transfigured into the sound of
triumphant music. And all the while the
voice of the little penitent, hidden from my
eyes, but almost within reach of my breath,
murmured in my ears: &#8220;I love you, I love
you, and that is my sin.&#8221; Dear girl, when
you have given me your heart, do you suppose
I shall be slow to confiscate your will?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
It is not lawful that a man&#8217;s, or a woman&#8217;s,
heart and will should be at enmity with
each other. I know that your will is strong,
but I know, too, that your heart is stronger.
Why did you turn me away without one
word of hope or consolation when I visited
you in Morningtown? Out of the great
store of happiness that God has given you,
could you not spare one little morsel? Ah,
I would not offer you up a sacrifice on the
altar of any spiritual creed, but take you
with me into that upper chamber that looks
toward the golden sunrise. I would share
your happiness and give you in return a
portion in the hope that I too have found.
With you at my side I could walk through
the world, (for I am not such a recluse
as you might suppose,) knowing that
the desire of all men&#8217;s hearts had fallen to
me, and that my life was consecrated henceforth
to noble uses. And yet to-day I am
very sad.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little story of the way
your admired Simonians act when their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
general promulgations of brotherhood are
brought to an individual test. Our proprietor
and manager, a smooth-faced,
meek-eyed Jew, who has made himself
right with this world, at least, is much
concerned with charities and civic meetings
and reform clubs and progress societies
and the preaching of universal democracy,
and all that,&mdash;a veritable Pharisee among
the humanitarians. He often asks me to
give a good word to some Simoniacal
book. Well, I have a poor broken-down
Irishman named O&#8217;Meara, who reviews a
certain class of publications for me. He is
the kind of man you would never expect to
meet in this country: a relic of eighteenth-century
Grub Street,&mdash;a man who reads
Latin and Greek, who can quote pages of
the Fathers, who has a high ideal of literature
and conscience in writing, and withal
a victim to the demon whiskey that has
dragged him down to the very gutter. His
life has been a mystery to me, and some
feeling of shame has kept him from ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
telling me where and how he lives. At
intervals he comes shuffling into my office,
with bleared eyes and palsied hand, and for
charity&#8217;s sake I give him a book to review&mdash;and
not exactly for charity either, for he
does his work well. Two or three weeks
ago our Simoniacal manager came into my
office and asked me who that tramp was
whom he had seen several times go away
with books. I told him the whole story,
thinking to arouse his sympathy. What
was my surprise when he broke out into
a mild stream of abuse&mdash;the more startling
because he ordinarily says so little&mdash;against
allowing such besotted tramps to come into
the offices! When a man drank himself
into such a state as that there was no doing
anything with him, etc. O&#8217;Meara came
back in a day or two with his &#8220;copy,&#8221; and
I told him that the chief had ordered me to
cut him off. Poor wretch! he said never a
word for himself, but turned and shambled
guiltily out of the room&mdash;I shall never forget
the sound of his trailing, despondent feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>I heard no more from him until yesterday,
when the office boy came in and told me a
beggar child insisted on seeing me. What
was my astonishment when it proved to
be our goblin boy, who had been sent to
ask me to come to his father; and his father
was O&#8217;Meara! It all seemed as unsubstantial
as a dream. I went with the child, of
course. He guided me through the dark
entry where I had seen him so often, in behind
a great printing house, to a foul court
hidden away from the street like some
criminal outlaw. I will not try to describe
the noisomeness of that reeking hole. I
found O&#8217;Meara lying on a heap of sacks in
a mouldering closet which was entirely
dark save for what little light came through
the doorway. Darkness, indeed, was his
only comfort. He would not shake hands
with me, for he has, withal, the instincts
of a gentleman, and it seemed as if the
shame of his whole degraded life lay with
him before me in his misery. His tragedy
will have been played out in a day or two,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
I think; and I wish the memory of it might
also pass from my mind. What shall I do
with the goblin boy? The hatefulness of
it all stands between me and my thoughts
of you. I cannot harden myself yet for a
while to dream of pure beauty. I read
your letter over and over, but its sweet
medicament cannot purge my breast. Not
even the acknowledgment of your love can
drown these sighs I have heard.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Mr. Philip Towers</span>:</p>
<p>You lack the proper ethical pose of a
Father Confessor. I have excommunicated
you. The charge against you is that you
take an audacious advantage of the confessional,
not to bless me, but to rejoice
in my romantic vagrancy. For a man giving
himself airs in the &#8220;upper chamber,&#8221;
you have very human ways, and I begin
to suspect you only keep your creed and
philosophy up there.</p>
<p>But you are greatly mistaken if you think
you can ever wheedle me into such a sunrise
attic. I can be domesticated, but not
etherealised. And you hold strange doctrines
for an ascetic. You think that because
I love it will be easy to &#8220;confiscate&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
my will. Even <i>I</i> know better than that.
We live to conquer our hearts. There is
no freedom of mind and spirit till that
decisive battle has been fought and won.
My heart is a gay vagabond, ready to dance
before the door of your tent, but my will
is better disciplined. It weighs and counts
the costs and rejects this sentimental bargain,
because, O Stranger to my soul, I
doubt if you can pay the interest love demands
upon so large an investment. There
is not enough of you; and your capital
consists in something less vital,&mdash;in wind-cooled
philosophies, and the passions of
an occult spirit ever ready to escape into
mysticism. Why will you not be content
with a companionship on this basis? You
keep your wings and you wish mine also.
Well, you shall not have them! I have
no disposition to simulate the example of
those small insects who come out in early
spring with splendid wings, make one
flight far enough through the sunlight to
lose them, and crawl all the remainder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
of their days in the domestic dust of their
little tenements.</p>
<p>Besides, does not the science of biology
teach that romantic love, in the very
nature of things, is transient?&mdash;a little
heathen angel that we entertain unawares,
who comes and goes at will? I cannot
tell you what satisfaction and what distress
that theory has caused me of late. I would
have my own heart free, but I am willing
to move my little heaven and earth to
prolong your bondage. Selfish?&mdash;I know,
but consider upon what loneliness and
terror such selfishness is based. A man
is always sufficient unto himself, particularly
if he can abstract and divert himself
into a line of thought as you are able to
do, but a woman without a lover is a
pathetic thing. There is no real reason
for her existence; all her little miracles of
expression and posing are for naught. She
is a sort of prima donna lost out of the
play. There is no one to give her the
happy cue to the whole meaning of life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
Oh, my Love! I <i>cannot</i> live without a
lover. Do not bereave me! I should shrivel
up, I am sure,&mdash;grow old and sour and
sad. I might even become a deaconess
with Hull-House propensities. I am a
naïve beggar, you see; I ask all you have,
and admit that I am unwilling to give in
return what I myself have.</p>
<p>Your account of O&#8217;Meara interests me.
But what right have you to slip out of your
stern character as a merely spiritual man,
and assume the guise of a good Samaritan?
Really it is not fair; your tender compassion
is illogical, and, however benign, I
cannot accept it as evidence in your favour.
But your account of the poor man&#8217;s distress
touched my heart. And you ask me
what ought to be done with the little
goblin boy. Dear Philip, could <i>we</i> not
adopt him? Think how many years then,
we should have to correspond in and to
dispute with each other about his upbringing!
I would make the jackets and you
should furnish the ethics for him. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
should provide a home for him, and I would
give a little of the warmth that any woman&#8217;s
tenderness imparts to any child. I
will begin at once with a maternal dictation,&mdash;he
must be sent into the country.
For children are like lambs, I think; they
also need to grow up in a green field, and
to gambol there. He must have no cares,
no obligations&mdash;just be encouraged to let
go all the good and evil there is in him.
When he has expanded to his natural size
morally and physically, we can tell better
what to do with him. Are you laughing
at me, or are you scandalised at such a
proposition? Then why did you ask my
advice? When a child is without parents,
is it not better to provide him with a pair
of them, even if one is a wizard who
knows how to metamorphose himself into
many different personalities, such as sage,
mystic, lover, good Samaritan, and I know
not how many more?

</div>

<p>[THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE PRECEDING
LETTER OF JESSICA&#8217;S, BUT WAS NOT RECEIVED UNTIL LATER.]</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Jessica</span>:</p>
<p>I often wonder whether I have made it
quite clear to you why it is possible to
hold in high esteem personally the workers
of Hull House and these other philanthropists,
while detesting their views as formulated
into a dogma. Just after I had
sent off my last letter to you I met with
something in a morning paper which will
throw light on my position. In an address
before Princeton Theological Seminary
Dr. Lyman Abbott is reported to have
used these words:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;To follow Christ is, first of all, to give yourself to
the service of God by serving your fellow-men. This is
more important than the question of the Trinity, of the
atonement, or of creeds.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Now the question of the Trinity or of the
atonement may not seem essential to me.
My faith has passed out of them&mdash;beyond
them, I trust; and at least I do not call
myself a Christian. But remember that
Dr. Abbott is a teacher of Christianity and
was on this occasion addressing students
of theology. Certainly to him and to his
audience these are, they must be, the first
of all matters in the realm of ideas, whether
accepted or rejected, and to speak slightingly
of them is to show contempt for
everything that transcends the material
world. I know that Dr. Abbott, like some
others, makes this service of our fellow-men
to be a form of the service of God;
but the slightest knowledge of the spirit
of the day, indeed any intelligent reading
of the words I have quoted, makes plain
how entirely this &#8220;service of God&#8221; is a
tag, a meaningless concession to an older
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
form of speech. What seriously concerns
our humanitarians is the service of mankind.
Now am I not justified in saying
that true religion would at least change
the order of ideas and declare that to serve
mankind is, first of all, to give one&#8217;s self
to the service of God? This is not a quibbling
of words, but a radical distinction.
It is because I find in all so-called humanitarians
this tendency to place humanity
before God, material needs before ideals,
that I call them, when all is said, the most
insidious foes of true religion. Their very
virtues make them more dangerous than
outspoken materialists and scoffers. It is
largely due to them and their creed that
we have no art and no literature; for art
and literature depend, at the last analysis,
on a reaching out after ideas, on an attempt
to transmute material things into spiritual
values,&mdash;on faith, in a word. The humanitarians
cry out against the materialism
and the commercial spirit of the age. They
do not perceive that the only remedy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
against this degeneracy is the renewal of
faith in something greater and higher than
our material needs. Let them preach for
a while the blessings of poverty and other-worldliness.
The attempt to instil benevolence
or so-called human justice into
society as the chief message of religion is
merely to play into the hands of the enemy.
Do you see why I call them the real followers
of Simon Magus, who sought to
buy the gift of God with a price? &#8220;Thou
hast neither part nor lot in this matter; for
thy heart is not right in the sight of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consider how impossible it would have
been in any age of genuine or real creativeness
for a leading preacher of Christianity
to have pronounced Dr. Abbott&#8217;s words,
and you will see how far humanitarianism
has fallen from faith in the spirit. I know
that passages maybe quoted from the Bible
which might seem to make Christ himself
responsible for this new Simony; but
Satan, too, may quote Scripture. Surely
the whole tenor of Christ&#8217;s teaching is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
strongest rebuke to this lowering of the
spirit&#8217;s demands. He spent his life to
bring men into communion with God, not
to modify their worldly surroundings. Indeed,
the world was to him a place of
misery and iniquity, doomed to speedy
destruction. He sought to save a remnant
from the wrath of judgment as a brand is
plucked from the fire, and he separated his
disciples utterly from acquiescence in the
comforts of this earth; they were to be
in the world but not of it: &#8220;Render unto
Cæsar the things which are Cæsar&#8217;s, and
unto God the things that are God&#8217;s.&#8221; He
taught poverty and not material progress.
Those he praised were the poor and the
meek and the unresisting and the persecuted&mdash;those
who were cut off from the
hopes of the world.</p>
<p>And now, dear girl, do you ask me to
apply my preaching to my own case? Of
a truth I have faith. I think it my true
service to men that I should learn to love
you greatly; and out of that love shall flow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
charity and justice and righteousness toward
the world. Let it be my meed of
service that men shall see the beauty of
my homage.

<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>PHILIP TO JESSICA</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Jessica</span>:</p>
<p>The end has come even sooner than I
looked for it. This afternoon, little Jack,
our goblin boy, came to my office and I
followed him back to the dismal court
where his father lay expecting me. I had
arranged that the poor wretch should be
carried into a room where at least there
was a bed and where a ray of clean sunshine
might greet his soul when departing
on the long journey; and there I found him
lying perfectly quiet save for the twitching
of his hands outstretched on the counterpane.
I thought a glimmer of content
lightened his dull eyes as I sat down beside
him. I talked with him a little, but he
seemed scarcely to heed my words. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
turning his head towards me he plucked
from under his pillow an old thumb-worn
copy of <i>Virgil</i> (so bedraggled and spotted
that no second-hand book-seller would
have looked at it) and thrust it out to me,
intimating by a gesture that he would have
me read to him. I asked him where I
should begin, and he held up two fingers
as if to indicate the second book of the
<i>Æneid</i>; and there I began with the fall of
Troy-town.</p>
<p>He listened with apparent apathy, though
I know not what echoes the sonorous lines
awakened in his mind, until I came to the
words:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Venit summa dies et ineluctabile tempus.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I saw his hands clench together feebly here,
and then there was no more motion. Presently
I looked into his face, and I knew
that no sound of my voice, nor any sound
of the world, could ever reach him again;
for the story of his unspeakable sorrow,
like the ruin of Troy, had been told to the
end. He had spoken not a single word;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
he had carried the silence of his soul into
the infinite silences of death. The secret
of his life had passed with him. I shall
probably never know what early dreams
and ambitions had faded into this squalid
despair. And his pitiful wan-faced boy&mdash;who
was the child&#8217;s mother? I am glad I
do not know; I am only glad I can tell him
of your love. I shall see that the father is
buried decently with a wooden slab to distinguish
his grave from the innumerable
dead who rest in the earth. Might we not
print above his body the last words of the
poem he seems to have loved so much:
<i>Fugit indignata sub umbras</i>! For I think
it was the indignity of shame in the end
that killed him. Is he not now all that
Cæsar and Virgil are? Shall he not sleep
as peacefully in his pauper&#8217;s bed as the
great General Grant in that mausoleum
raised by the river&#8217;s side?&mdash;Commonplace
thoughts that came to me as I sat for a
while musing in the presence of death; but
is not death the inevitable commonplace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
that shall put to rout all our originality in
the end?</p>
<p>And all the while our Jack was sitting
perfectly motionless by the window, looking
out into the court&mdash;into the blue sky,
I think. I picked up one of his thin hands
and said to him: &#8220;Little Jack, your father
has gone away from us and is at rest.
There is a beautiful lady in the South who
loves you as she loves me; will not her
love make you happy?&#8221; He did not appear
to understand me, but shrank into
himself as if afraid. Indeed, sweet benefactress,
I shall send him into the country
somewhere as you bid me, and I shall see
that your love brings him greater happiness
than it has brought me, for with him
you shall not withdraw with one hand
what you have held out in the other.</p>
<p>I went away, leaving an old woman to
care for the dead man and his child. It
will be long before I forget how alien and
far-away the noises of the street sounded
as I passed out of that chamber of silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Is it not a strange thing that death should
have this power of benediction? Of a sudden
a breath comes out of the heavens, our
little cares are touched by an eternal presence,
a rift is blown in the thick mists that
hem us about, and behold, we look out
into infinite visionless space. And now I
am back in my office. I open O&#8217;Meara&#8217;s
worn and much-stained <i>Virgil</i>, and inside
the cover I find these words scribbled in
pencil: &#8220;<i>I have cried unto God and He
hath not heard my cry; but thou, O beloved
poet, art ever near with consolation</i>!&#8221;
I do not know whether the sentence is
original with O&#8217;Meara or a quotation; it is
certainly new to me. One other book I
brought with me, and the two were the
whole worldly possession of the dead man.
This is a small but pretty thick blank-book,
written over almost to the last page. I
have not examined the contents carefully,
but I can see that they are made up of miscellaneous
passages copied from books and
of reflections on a great variety of topics,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
with few or no records of events. One of
the last entries is from Clarence Mangan&#8217;s
heart-breaking poem, <i>The Nameless One</i>:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And tell how now, amid wreck and sorrow,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And want, and sickness, and houseless nights,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>That no ray lights.</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Here, and in hell.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And is it not a touch of Fate&#8217;s irony that
I should be sending this threnody of death
to one who might expect to receive from
me only messages and pleadings of love?
Death and love are the very antipodes of
our existence, one would say. And yet I
do not know; I feel nothing incongruous
in linking the twain together. Love, too,
breaks open the barriers of our poor personality
that the breath of the infinite may
blow in upon us. I cannot say how it is
with others, but so it is with me: love lays
a hand upon me, and instantly the discords
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
of the world are hushed in my ears, the
little desires and fears that trouble me are
shamed into silence, and I am rapt away
into the infinitely great heart that throbs at
the centre of all. It is strange, but life
itself seems to pass away in the presence
of this power that is the creator of life. I
speak darkly, but my words have a meaning.
And, dear sweetheart, be not afraid
that you shall be left without a lover;
that I shall bereave you! Do you think
for an instant that I can cease to love?
I cannot understand this war between your
heart and your will; am I very stupid?
Surely when I come to you, I shall bring
this contention to an end, and you&mdash;it hath
not entered into the heart of man to conceive
what you shall give me. Out of
the conclusions of death into the prophecies
of love! I am filled with wondering.</p>
<p>You shall hear more hereafter of poor
Jack, our adopted child.

<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>JESSICA TO PHILIP</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Philip</span>:</p>
<p>See how you shame me! For this long
while I have wished to begin my letters
thus, but I waited, hoping you would entreat
me to do so. I expected you to
provide an excuse. I thought my own
pleasure would wear the genial air of a
concession to your wishes. Indeed, the
way you wait for me to be obliged to do
such things of my own accord, fills me
with superstitious anxieties. It is as if you
had some unfair foreknowledge of the
natural order of events. You would take
things for granted, and thus produce an
hypnotic effect by your convictions so
strong as to compel my conformity. But I
console myself with the reflection that all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
this is mental. You terrify only my intelligence
with your strange sorcery. And
for this reason I shall always escape your
bondage, for I am too wise to concede my
familiar territory to such an overbearing
foreign power.</p>
<p>However, I must not forget the prime
object I have in writing this letter. It is to
tell you that the little box of childish things,
which you must have received already and
wondered at, are <i>not</i> for the literary editor
of <i>The Gazette</i>, but for Jack, sent with the
hope that they may in some measure
comfort his sad heart. I went so far as to
purchase material for the promised set of
jackets, when suddenly I remembered that
I was ignorant of both his age and size.
You have never told me that, though you
have given me such a real picture of him
that I could almost trust my imagination
to cut those garments to fit him!</p>
<p>Your account of O&#8217;Meara&#8217;s death affected
me deeply. With what sublime abandon
does such a man let go his soul into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
mystery of that silence which we call
eternity!</p>
<p>Is it not strange how the same impressions
come to many, but by different
ways! &#8220;It will be long before I forget
how alien and far-away the noises of the
street sounded as I passed out of that
chamber of silence,&#8221; you said, and the
sentence recalled a somewhat similar experience
of my own on Cumberland Island,
where father and I went last summer for
a short vacation. One day, leaving the
group of happy bathers to their surf, I
climbed up inland among the sand-hills,
that lie along the shore like the white pillows
of fabulous sea-gods. Presently I
came upon one of those great sand-pits
that stretch along the Island, deep and
wide like mighty graves. Far below me
a whole forest stood in ghostly silence,
with every whitening limb lifted in supplication,
as if all had died in a terrified
struggle with the engulfing sands. Unawares,
I had happened upon one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
Nature&#8217;s griefs&mdash;and I do not know how
to tell you, but the sight of it aged me.
Of a sudden this death of the trees seemed
a far-off part of my own experience. I
was swept out of this contesting, energetic
world into a still region where great events
come to pass in silence, and inevitably.
And so real was the illusion that, as I
turned to hurry back, it seemed to me
that centuries had passed since I saw the
same little tuft of flowers like a group of
purple fairies nodding to me from the top
of a tall cliff. And so I stood there confused
by the significance of this silence,
so incredible that even the winds could
not shake it. I felt so near and kin to
death that I became &#8220;alien&#8221; to all the
living world about me. For the first time
in my life, I lost the <i>sense</i> of God, which
is always a kind of mental protection
against the terrors of infinity. There was
nothing to pray to, only the sea on one
side and this grave on the other, with a
little trembling life between.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>Thus you will understand that not only
have I had a similar experience to your
own upon the occasion of O&#8217;Meara&#8217;s death,
but that for once I came into your region
of shades and terrors. I was like one on
the point of dissolution, and almost my
soul escaped into your dim habitation.
From your letters I had already learned
how near together love and death stood
in your consciousness. Each is an exit
through which your spirit is ever ready
to pass. And for the moment, crowded in
with skeleton shadows there, you seemed
sensibly near me. I was divided between
fear and love. But the blood of life in me
always triumphs,&mdash;and then it was that I
made my first flight in consciousness from
you. I kissed my hand to the twilight and
ran! I am sure you were there, Philip, a
cold-lipped spirit-lover seeking my mortal
life. And, oh my Heart! is it wrong that
I would love and be loved in the flesh?
I do not object to spirituality, only it must
have a visible presence and a warm cheek.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>P. S.&mdash;But, dear Philip, how am I to
reconcile this tender charity to Jack with
your anti-humanitarian views? Is a man&#8217;s
heart so divided from his philosophy? Or
do you intend to make a mystic of that
poor child, so that he may escape the
woes of his condition? I am curious to
see what you will do with him. Also,
I shall certainly defend him against your
Nirvana doctrines if I suspect you of juggling
with his soul.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear, teasing, rare Jessica</span>:</p>
<p>I have so many things to say to you.
First of all, why do you blame me for my
&#8220;foreknowledge&#8221;? You scold me for my
hostility to the sentimentalism of the day,
you scold me then for any act of common
human sympathy, and now you take me
to task because I foresee how you will address
me in a letter. Dear me, what a
horrid little scold it is! I wonder you
didn&#8217;t quote <i>The Raven</i>,&mdash;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Prophet!&#8221; said I, &#8220;thing of evil!&mdash;prophet still,
if bird or devil!&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>But really no great powers of prophecy
were required. Have you forgotten that
in the very letter before this one you called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
me &#8220;Dear Philip&#8221;? And wasn&#8217;t that a
good index of your tempestuous, contradictory
sweet self, that you should have
begun your letter &#8220;My dear Mr. Philip
Towers&#8221; and then thrown in your &#8220;Dear
Philip&#8221; by the way, as if it would not
be observed! Why, my naughty Jessica,
when I came to that phrase, I just took
my longest, biggest blue pencil and put
a ring about it so that I might find it at
a moment&#8217;s notice and feast my eyes a
thousand thousand times on its sweet familiarity.
Do not suppose that anything
ever escapes me in your letters. I con
every little lapse in your spelling until I
know it by heart. And you do make so
many slips, you know, in your reviews as
well as in your letters! I never correct
them,&mdash;that would be a desecration, I
think,&mdash;but send up your copy just as
it comes to me. Indeed, I find myself
imitating unawares some of your most unaccountable
originalities. Only the other
day I was in the reading-room and our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
head proofreader, a sour, wizened old
man, cried out to me: &#8220;I say, Mr. Towers,
what is the matter with your spelling?
You write <i>propotion</i><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for proportion and
<i>propersition</i> for proposition, and get your
<i>r</i>&#8217;s all mixed up generally!&#8221; There was
a titter from all the girls in the room.
Then said I: &#8220;Thou fool! knowest thou
not that Jessica lives in the South, and
treats her <i>r</i>&#8217;s with royal contempt as she
was taught to treat the black man? And
shall I not imitate her in this as in all
her high-born originalities?&#8221; Of course I
didn&#8217;t say that aloud, but just thought it
to myself. And really I do wonder sometimes
that your excellent father, when he
taught you Latin, should have permitted
you to take such liberties with our good
mother tongue. But after all it is only
another sign of your right Southern wilfulness.
Do you not take even greater liberties
with poor human souls?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>And you make my prophetic powers a
bulwark for your licentious rebellion and
declare that you will always escape my
bondage. Shall you, indeed? You once
intimated that I wore ass&#8217;s ears. I begin
to believe it. What a blind, solemn animal
I was when I came to Morningtown
to beg for your love! I was so afraid of
you. And as we sat in the circle of your
watching, motionless trees, something of
their stiff ways entered into my heart. I
told you of my love so solemnly, and you
answered so solemnly. Fool! Fool! I
should have spoken not a single word,
but just taken you in my arms and kissed
you once and twice. Don&#8217;t frown now,
it is too late. There would have been one
wild, tempestuous outbreak of indignation,
and then my dryad maiden would have
known my &#8220;foreknowledge&#8221; indeed. Is
it too late to rehearse that curtain-raiser?
Dear girl, I would be merry, but I am not
so sure that all is well with my heart. I
need you so much now, for I have entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
on a new path and the way is obscure
before me. I need you. Your hand in
mine would give me the courage I require.</p>
<p>Do you remember how you warned me
of dangers when I reviewed Miss Addams&#8217;s
book? You, too, were a prophet. Let
me tell you how it all came about. The
other day I wrote up Mme. Adam&#8217;s <i>Romance
of My Childhood and Youth</i> (Addams
and Adam&mdash;the name has a fatality
for me), and took occasion to make it the
text of a tremendous preachment against
our latter-day Simony,&mdash;as well it might
be, for Mme. Adam grew up in the thirties
and forties when France was a huge seething
caldron in which all these modern
notions were brewing together. And unfortunately
we are just beginning now
where France left off a score of years ago.
You have already seen the review, no
doubt, and it is superfluous to repeat its
argument. But for my own justification
to you I want to quote a few sentences
from the book. You disdained to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
any reply to my letter on Lyman Abbott,
and I fear you have grown weary of the
whole subject; but certainly you will be
interested in what I am copying out for
you now. In one of her chapters, then,
Mme. Adam writes:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Nature, Science, Humanity, are the three terms of
initiation. First comes nature, which rules everything;
then the revelations of nature, revelations which mean
science&mdash;that is to say, phenomena made clear in themselves
and observed by man; and lastly, the appropriation
of phenomena for useful social purposes....
There is no error in nature, no perversity in man; evil
comes only from society.... He [Mme. Adam&#8217;s
father] delighted in proving to me that it was useless for
man to seek beyond nature for unattainable chimeras,
for the infinite which our finite conception was unable
to understand, and for the immaterial, which our
materiality can never satisfactorily explain....
They [these humanitarian socialists] resembled my father.
Their doubts&mdash;and they had many!&mdash;were of
too recent a date to have dried up their souls; <i>they no
longer believed in a divine Christ; they still believed
in a human one</i>. They worshipped that mysterious
Science, which replaced for them the supernatural, and
which had not then brought all its brutality to light in
crushing man under machinery.</p>
</div>
<p>Could anything be more illuminating
than that? Does it not set forth the close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
cousinship of humanitarianism with socialism
and the fungous growth of the two
out of the mouldering ruins of faith and
the foul reek of a sensuous philosophy?
And do you not see why any surrender to
this modern cult of human comfort means
the indefinite postponement of that fresh-dawning
ideal which shall bring life to literature
and art and evoke once more the
golden destiny of man?</p>
<p>Well, this morning the particular Simon
Magus who rules <i>The Gazette</i> walked into
my office and, after some preliminary sparring,
came out with a complaint which I
knew had been preparing in his brain for
some time. It seems that he had already
been deluged with letters about my heretical
attack on Miss Addams, and now a
new storm had begun over my further
delinquencies. He kindly told me that my
views were a hundred years behind the
age and that they were doing injury to
the paper. Against the latter charge I had
no defence, and immediately capitulated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
To cut a disagreeable tale short, I anticipated
his purpose and offered to make way
for some man who would better harmonise
with the benevolent policy of the
paper. The first of the month comes in
four days, and then I shall be thrown once
again on my own resources. The shock,
though expected, is a little disconcerting;
for at times a man grows weary and discouraged
in fighting against the perpetual
buffeting of the current. But most of all
I am wondering how my independence
will affect the hopes that were beginning
to colour my dreams. Dear Jessica, you
will not forsake me now; you will put
away your perversity and love me simply
and unreservedly? There are difficulties
before me, I know; but I am not afraid
if only my heart is at peace. I am free,
and if there is any power in my brain,
any skill in my right hand, I will make
such a pother that the world shall hear
me. I will not die till I am heard. And
so I ask you to help-me. With your love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
I shall be made bold, and no opposition
and no repeated reverses shall trouble me.
And in the end your happiness is in my
making.</p>
<p>Indeed, your box of little things for Jack
made Olympian merriment in Newspaper
Row, for several men were in my office
when I opened it. Jack is ten years old,
small for his age, but quietly precocious.
I cannot write more of him now. Address
your next letter not to the office but
to&mdash;&mdash;; and when I open that letter will
it bring me joy or grief? Your joy may
cast a ruddy light on my path, but nothing
that you can say will shake me in
my firm resolve. No sorrow shall hinder
me, but, oh, happy Heart! I, too, long for
happiness.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Kind Sir</span>:</p>
<p>Which do you think requires the more
grace in a woman, to hold out against a
dear enemy or to yield? My own experience
teaches me that there is more facility
in resistance. Acting thus I have always
felt in accord with natural instincts, and
there is a barbaric sense of security in following
them.... Yet I have only
one thing to tell you in reply to your &#8220;so
many.&#8221; Can you guess what it is? Already
I think the birds know it. I have so far
departed from my natural order of perversity
and self-protection that they feel it, and
twitter together when I pass by. I think
they look down upon me now with high-feathered
contempt. Could anything be
more mortifying?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>Do not laugh, Philip! You have behaved
little better than a robber in this matter. I
have lost to you, but the game was not
fair; dear mendicant, you played with a
card up your sleeve! All my life I have
planned to outwit predestination. I have
ignored Sabbath-day doctrines and faith-binding
dogmas to this end. I could even
have held out indefinitely against your
&#8220;foreknowledge,&#8221; but when you come,
heralded by an unexpected misfortune, asking
&#8220;peace&#8221; of me that you may meet your
own difficulties with a steadier courage, I
find you invincible. It is as if you had
suddenly slipped through the door of my
heart and left will, betrayed, on guard outside.
I have no defence in my nature
against your plea. The diplomacy of your
need takes me unawares, and, no matter
how I fear the future, now I am bound to
add myself to you in love and hope. The
prospect is terrible and sweet. Already it
has made me a stranger in my father&#8217;s
house, a foreigner among the trees, and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
wakeful, frightened mystery to myself. I
am full of tears and secresy. I am no
longer Jessica, the wind-souled dryad of
the forest, but merely a woman in definition,
facing a new world of pain and joy.
Oh, my beloved! you have taken all that I
have, all that I am! Henceforth I shall be
only a part of you,&mdash;a little hyperbole of
domesticity always following after, or advancing
to meet you.... Dear gods
of the world, defend me from such a fate!
... After all, I cannot admit the &#8220;one
thing.&#8221; I cannot submit to this annihilation,
this absorption of character and personality.
If you take me, you do so at your
own risk, I will not promise &#8220;peace,&#8221;
but confusion rather. But if you get me,
you must take me. Yet, if you come to
Morningtown after me, I will deny my
love, not out of perversity, but out of fear.
The sight of you is a signal for me to take
refuge upon my tallest bough. And I can
no more come down to you than a young
lady robin could fly into your pocket. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
is all very well for you to exhort me to
love you &#8220;simply and unreservedly,&#8221;&mdash;I
do. Nothing could be simpler, more elemental,
than my love is; and do I reserve
a single thought of it from you? But I am
not conventional enough in heart or training
to surrender. My genius for you does
not extend so far. To lose myself does
not seem to me wise or logical, however
scriptural or legal the practice is. The
truth is, I cannot agree to be taken, any
more than the little petticoated planet above
your head can kick off her diadem of light.
I do not know what you will do about it,
because it is not my business to know
these things. All I am sure of is that I
love you, and that I belong to you if only
you can get my extradition papers from
Nature herself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have ventured to prepare my
father&#8217;s mind for a new idea. As we sat
before the library fire this evening, each
employed according to his calling, he with
Fletcher&#8217;s <i>Appeal</i> and I with my sewing, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
asked the usual introductory question to
our conversations. And it is always the
signal for him to raise his shield of orthodoxy;
for it has long been my habit to
creep around the corner of my private
opinion and tease him with what he is
pleased to term &#8220;the most blasphemous
speculations.&#8221; Therefore when I said,
&#8220;Father, I wish to ask you a question,&#8221; he
looked up with the guarded eye of a man
who expects an assault from an unscrupulous
antagonist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my daughter, ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which would you advise me to marry,
father, a humanitarian whose highest law
is the material welfare of his kind, or an
ascetic whose spirituality is something more
and something less than scriptural?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither, Jessica; if you must marry,
choose a man who believes in the divinity
of Christ and lives somewhere within the
limits of the Ten Commandments!&#8221;&mdash;Heavens!
think of bondage with a man
who is bounded upon the north, east,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
south, and west of his soul by laws enacted
to discipline the Israelites in the Wilderness!
In that case, I should insist upon a
bridal trip to Canaan, with the hope of
reaching the Promised Land as a widow.</p>
<p>And this reminds me to ask you what
manner of man you are yourself. Do you
reflect that we have seen each other only
twice? and both times you were on guard,
once as an editor, and once as a lover.
Even your face has faded to a mere shadow,
and, if you persist in your petulant obstinacy
about the picture<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, is like to vanish
clean away into nothing. Only your encompassing
eyes peer at me with solemn
expostulation out of the shimmering form I
conjure up and call my lover. Is it quite
fair, Philip? And as for your character, my
hope is that, in spite of your mental pose
as a sage, you have an unreasonable disposition,
a chaotic temper. A long term
of years with a serene, gentle-spirited man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
would be unbearable to me. Rather than
prolong the futility of existence with one I
could not provoke, even enrage, I should
commit suicide. My own disposition is so
equally divided between perversity and repentance
that I could not endure the placidity,
the ennui, of a level turnpike existence.</p>
<p>And now isn&#8217;t it an evidence of your
high-minded heartlessness, that in the same
letter where you sue for love you also
introduce a philosophical discussion and
show even more heat in maintaining it
than you do in your amorous petition?
Why I cannot take warning and fly to the
ends of my earth away from you now
while there is yet time, is a mystery to
me!</p>
<p>And so you expect to make such a
pother in your opposition to the spirit of
the times that all the world will hear you.
Dear Master, I doubt if you will! Your bells
ring too high up. The angels in heaven
may hear you, but men are not listening in
that direction. I did not reply to your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
contention against Lyman Abbott, because
it is a far cry from you to me on this subject.
In consciousness we are at opposite
ends of a great problem, and I think the
normal man walks somewhere between.
Besides, I am not sure that I understand
your position; I am not familiar with the
starry highways of your mind. Still, in a
general way it has always seemed to me
that material things are, after all, &#8220;counters
which represent spiritual realities.&#8221; And I
take comfort in the fact that it must require
us all to work out the Great Plan,&mdash;humanitarian,
sage, pilgrim, ascetic, even the
butcher and candlestick maker. And while
we do not know it, really we are working
together for one end hidden now in the
divine economy of far-off destiny and justice....
To me the wonder of wonders
is that I may some day light a little
taper in your upper chamber myself, and
kneel together with you before the same
window to worship. Only, dear Heart,
please get your deity named before I come!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;As to my spelling, that is a coquettish
licence I take with the genealogy of
words. And you may tell your proofreader
that the letter <i>r</i> has never been
popular in the South since the war. There
is hauteur in my omission of it, and it is a
fact that we can express ourselves with far
more vigour without <i>g</i>&#8217;s or <i>r</i>&#8217;s than you of
the North can with them. For expression
with us is not scholastic, but temperamental!

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Kind Madam</span>:</p>
<p>Yes, a little more than kind, dear Jessica,
for you have put into my grasp the flower
of perfect delight, and &#8220;my hand retains a
little breath of sweet.&#8221; You have opened
a window into my heart and poured through
it the warmth and golden glory of your
own sunlight. I am filled with a joyousness
of a new spring&mdash;and yet there is
something in your letter that makes me a
little sad. You express so frankly that reserve
of resentment, even of bitterness,
which always, I think, abides with a woman
in all the sweetness of her love, but
which with most women never comes to
entire consciousness. Listen, dear Heart,
while I talk to you of yourself and myself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
until we comprehend each other better.
It is so much easier for me to understand
you than for you to understand me, because
a woman&#8217;s nature is single, whereas
a man&#8217;s is double, and in this duality lies
all the reason of that enmity of the sexes
which draws us together yet still holds us
asunder.</p>
<p>You complain of my letter because I argue
a philosophical proposition in it while
pleading for love. Do you not know that
this is man&#8217;s way? And I would not try to
deceive you: this philosophical proposition,
which seems to you almost a matter of indifference,
is more to me than everything
else in the world. For it I could surrender
all my heart&#8217;s hope; for it I could sacrifice
my own person; even, if the choice were
necessary, which cannot be, I might sacrifice
you. There is this duality in man&#8217;s
nature. The ambition of his intellect, the
passion, it may be, to force upon the world
some vision of his imagination or some
theorem of his brain, works in him side by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
side with his personal being, and the two
are never quite fused. Can you not recall
a score of examples in history of men who
have led this dual existence? You reviewed
for me Bismarck&#8217;s Love Letters and
were yourself struck by this sharp contrast
between the iron determination of the
man in public affairs and the softness and
sweetness of his domestic life. That is but
one case in point of the eternal dualism in
masculine nature which a woman can never
comprehend, and which always, if it confronts
her nakedly, she resents. For a woman
is not so. There exists no such gap
in her between her heart and brain, between
her outer and inner life. And the
consequence shows itself in many ways.
She is less efficient in the world and is
never a creator or impresser of new ideas;
but, on the other hand, her character possesses
a certain unity that is the wonder
of all men who observe. She calls the
man selfish and is bitter against him at
times, but her accusation is wrong. It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
not selfishness which leads a man if needs
be to cut off his own personal desires while
sacrificing another; it is the power in him
which impels the world into new courses.
A man&#8217;s virtues are aggressive and turned
toward outer conquest and may have little
relation to his own heart. But a woman&#8217;s
virtues are bound up with every impulse of
her personal being; they work out in her
a loveliness and unity of character which
make the man appear beside her coarse and
unmoral. Men of vicious private life have
more than once been benefactors of the human
race; I think that never happened in
the case of a woman.</p>
<p>And because of this harmony, this unconsciousness
in woman&#8217;s virtue, a man&#8217;s
love of woman takes on a form of idealisation
which a woman never understands
and indeed often resents. What in him
is something removed from himself, something
which he analyses and governs and
manipulates, is in the woman beloved an
integral part of her character. Virtue seems
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
in her to become personified and he calls
her by strange names. For this reason men
who make language tend always to give to
abstract qualities the feminine gender, as
you must have observed in Latin and might
observe in a score of other tongues. For
this reason, too, a man&#8217;s love of woman
assumes such form of worship as Dante
paid to Beatrice or Petrarch to Laura. It
would be grotesque for a woman to love
in this way, for virtue is not a man&#8217;s character,
but a faculty of his character. And
so is it strange that I should approach you
asking for love that my soul may have
peace? It cannot enter into my comprehension
that such a cry should come from
you to me. All that I strive to accomplish
in the world, all that I gird myself to battle
for, the ideals that I would lay down my
life that men may behold and cherish,&mdash;is
it not now all gathered up in the beauty
and serenity of your own person? What
I labour to express in words is already yours
in inner possession. If I ask you for peace,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
it is not selfishness, dear girl; it is prayer.
If you should come to me begging for
peace, I should be filled with amazement;
for I myself have it not. What I can give
is love&#8217;s unwearied tenderness and love&#8217;s
unceasing homage to the beauty of your
body and your soul. More than that, I
shall give you in the end the crown of the
world&#8217;s honour. Without you I may accomplish
the task laid upon me, but only
with heaviness of soul and abnegation of
all that my heart craves. I was reading in
an old drama last night until I came to
these words, and then I set the book aside:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Mounted and sung, thinking them moving skies.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>In that sweet hyperbole I seemed to read a
transcript of your beauty. If I am selfish,
beloved, all love is selfishness.</p>
<p>Dear girl, it seems that always I must
woo you in metaphysics and express my
ardour in theorems. But have I not made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
myself understood? &#8220;Man&#8217;s love is of
man&#8217;s life a thing apart,&#8221; as a thousand
women have quoted: and it is true. But
do you not see that even for this reason
his love swells into a passionate idolatry of
the woman who knows no such cleavage
in her soul. Try us with sacrifices. I
could throw away every earthly good to
bestow on you a year of happiness&mdash;only
not my philosophic proposition, as you
sarcastically call it. That is greater than I
and greater than you&mdash;pray heaven it do
not clash with the promise of our peace.
Virgil, I think, meant to exhibit such a
tragic conflict in his tale of Æneas and
Dido, only poetwise the inner impulse
which worked within Æneas he expressed
dramatically as a messenger from the gods.
It shows but little understanding of the
poem or of human nature to censure Æneas
as a cold egotist. Did he not sail away
carrying anguish in his heart, <i>multa gemens</i>?
For him there was destined toil and warfare,
for Dido only terror and death. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
tragedy fell hardest upon the woman, for
so the Fates have ordered.</p>
<p>But why do I write such grim reflections?
There is no tragedy, no separation,
for us, but a great wonder of happiness:</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>All the marvellous words of the poets rush
into my brain when I think of this new
blessing. Yes, I have acted a robber&#8217;s
part, sweet Jessica, and he who ravished
that great jewel from the Indian idol never
carried away so large a draft on the world&#8217;s
happiness as this that I have stolen. I
cannot be repentant while this golden glow
is upon me; later I shall begin to question
my own worthiness.</p>
<p>I cannot now tell you one half that is in
my mind to write, or answer one half the
questions in your letter. Jack is living
with me just at present, but of him I will
speak next time. I have planned to change

I would not attempt to give a name to the
deity I serve in a postscript, as it were.

<p>WRITTEN BEFORE THE RECEIPT OF THE PRECEDING LETTER</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Beloved</span>:</p>
<p>Last night, I dreamed myself away to
you. I walked beside you, a little wraith
of love, through the silent night streets of
your great city,&mdash;but you did not know
me. There was no sky above us, only a
hollow blackness, and the snow lay new
and white upon the pavements; but I wore
green leaves in my hair and a red Southern
rose on my breast to remind you of a
brown forest maid and summer-time far
away&mdash;and you would not see me! I faced
you in gay mockery and swept a bow, but
the blue silence in your eyes terrified me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
I held out my hands beseechingly, touched
my cheek to yours, and you did not feel
the pressure. Then I slipped down upon
the snow and wept, and you did not hear
me.</p>
<p>We were both &#8220;in the spirit,&#8221; I think.
Only, dear Love, when I am in the spirit,
all my thoughts are of you; but though I
looked far and near, I could not find in all
your regions one little thought of poor
Jessica. All was misty and dim within
your portals. <i>Your</i> thoughts were vague
ancient shapes that wandered past me like
Brahmin ghosts. And not one gallant
memory of Jessica legended upon those
inner walls of yours!</p>
<p>Dear, I cannot escape now, my heart
<i>will</i> not come back to me; and since it is
too late I will not complain. But for a
little while I must tell you these things and
pray for your kind comfort, till I shall have
become accustomed to your attic moods
and exaltations.</p>
<p>Do you recall the woman I told you of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
last summer, whose sorrow-smitten face
in the church terrified me so? Grief became
credible to me as I gazed at her.
And could it have been, do you think, a
message foretold to me of this magic future,
full of intangible fears, wherein I am to live
with you?

<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>PHILIP TO JESSICA</p>
</div>

<p>Love is a mystic worker of miracles, O
my sweet visionary! for on that very day
when you dreamed yourself away to me I
beheld you suddenly standing before me,
so life-like and appearing so wistfully beautiful
that I reached out my hand to touch
you&mdash;but grasped only the impalpable air.
All day and late into the night I had been
reading and reflecting, seeking in the ways
of thought some word of comfort for the
human heart, until at last my consciousness
became confused. It often happens
thus. So real is this search for some truth
outside of me, that it seems as if my soul
were a thing apart from me, a thing which
left me to go alone on its dim and perilous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
way. I behold it as it were a shadow
floating away from me out into that abyss
of shadows which are the thoughts of
many men long dead. And on this occasion
the silence into which the Searcher
went forth was vaster and more obscure
than ever before, filled with unfathomable
darkness as a clear night might look
wherein no moon or stars appeared, and
so lonely &#8220;that God himself scarce seemed
to be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as often when this mood comes
upon me, I went out to walk under the
hard flaring lights and amid the streaming
crowds of Broadway, in order to bring
back the sense of mortal illusion and unite
myself once more to human existence.
The people were pouring from the theatres,
and I sought the densest throng. But still
I could not awaken in myself the illusion
of life. And then suddenly, without warning,
there in the noisy brawl of the street,
I beheld you standing before me, looking
into my face and smiling. You wore a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
burning Southern rose upon your breast
and were more wondrously and delicately
fair than the dream of poets. And there
was a smile upon your lips as if to say:
&#8220;Dear Philip, thou hast put away the
pleasures and loveliness of this world as
they had been a snaring web of illusion;
yet I do but look upon thee, and forthwith
thou art pierced with love and know that
in this scorned desire of beauty dwells the
great reality.&#8221; I reached out my hand to
touch the rose against your heart, but the
vision was gone, and all about me was
only the tumultuous mockery of the street.
Sweetheart, you have smitten me with
remorse. Shall I take from you only happiness,
and give in return only this spectral
dread? Ah, you shall learn that I am very
real, very earthly, capable of love and tenderness
and daily duties and quiet human
sympathies! I told you of the dualism into
which my life, into which, indeed, every
man&#8217;s life, is cast; why will you persist in
clinging to that part which is cold and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
inhuman instead of seizing upon that which
is warm and very near by? I would not
take you with me into those bleak ways
where always there is fear lest our personality
be swallowed up in the dark impersonal
abyss. I would love you as a man
loves a woman and cleaves to her. Nay,
more, I perceive dimly in that love a strange
reconcilement wherein the dual forces of
my nature shall be made one, wherein truth
and beauty shall blend together in a kiss,
and there shall be no more seeking in obscurity,
but only peace.</p>
<p>When the vision faded from me on
Broadway, I turned back to my home, and
there, before the dawn came, tried to write
out in words one thought of the many that
thronged upon me. I have almost forgotten
the art of making rhymes if ever I
knew it.</p>

</div>

<p>WRITTEN IN ANSWER TO LETTER XXIX</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Philip</span>:</p>
<p>You are a magician rather than a lover.
And no lover, I think, was ever so subtle
at reasoning. At least you do not act the
part as I supposed it was played. A lover,
I thought, was one who stood at the door
of a woman&#8217;s heart and serenaded till she
crept out upon her little balcony of sighs
and kissed her hand to him, or shed a
tokening bloom upon his upturned countenance.
So far as I could imagine, he was
prehistoric in the simplicity of his methods.
Two things I never suspected: that love
is the kind of romantic exegesis you represent
it to be, or that every lover, psychically,
is a sort of twin phenomenon&mdash;that
he is <i>two</i> men instead of one! And after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
he is married, I suppose he will be a domestic
<i>trinity</i>, but with his godhead concerned
with the affairs of the world at
large. I am awed by the revelation; still,
it excuses much in my conduct that I had
before felt was reprehensible; for I have
scarcely faced my own reflection in the
glass since my ignominious capitulation.
Something within charged treachery against
poor Jessica. But if there are <i>two</i> of you,
and only <i>one</i> of me, that fact gives a new
and honourable complexion to my part in
the transaction.</p>
<p>However, the way you have multiplied
yourself and doubled forces upon me may
be good masculine tactics, but I am sure
it is an unparliamentary advantage you
have taken. For you have not only posed
as a lover, but with the cunning words of
a logician you prove what seemed wrong
to be really a sublime right; and what <i>I</i>
charged as selfishness, <i>you</i> call &#8220;a prayer.&#8221;
I am confused by your argument; it seems
incontestable. But do you know, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Philip, that a woman&#8217;s convictions are
never reached by a mere argument? For
they are hidden in her heart, not in her
little bias-fold mind. And so, in spite of
your sweet reasoning with me, and the
assumption you make of omniscience concerning
me, my convictions remain. Only,
now, I do not know whether I cherish
them against you or against the God who
made me simple and you double.</p>
<p>But granting all you say to be true, that
every man has a personal life and at the
same time a universal life energy as well,
that there is in him a little domestic fortress
of love, and a battle power of life apart,&mdash;admitting
all this, how do you reconcile
justice with the fact that you frankly offer
only half of your duality for all of Jessica?
Have you never suspected that she also
has fair kingdoms of thought apart from
your science of her? My Prophet, it is
you who have discovered them to me!
Love has added a sweet Canaan to my
little hemisphere. I have heard invisible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
birds singing, I have trysted with spirits
of the air since I knew you. And I have
felt the pangs of a consciousness in me so
new and so tender, that I am no longer
merely the maid you know, but, dear
Master, I am some one else, near and kin
to you as life and spirit are kin! What is
this strange white space in my soul that
love has made, so real, yet so holy that
I dare not myself lift the veil of consciousness
before it? And all I know is that I
shall meet you there finally heart to heart!&mdash;Philip,
kiss me! For I am a frightened
white-winged stranger in my own new
heavens and new earth. I am no longer
as you imagine, simply one, but I have a
foreign power of life and death in me, and
the fact terrifies me.</p>
<p>You declare that there is a difference and
a distance between a man&#8217;s love and a man&#8217;s
mind which account for his dual nature.
There is also an intelligence of the heart,
more astute, more vital, which divides
woman&#8217;s nature also between the abandon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
of love and the resentment of understanding.
We know, and we do not know,
and we <i>feel</i>. What we know is of little
consequence, what we feel is written upon
the faces of each succeeding generation.
But what we do <i>not</i> know constitutes that
element of mystery in us that makes us
also dual. For we feel and suspect further
than we can understand. Thus, your faculty
for projecting yourself in spirit further
than I can follow, excites in me a terror
of loneliness that sharpens into resentment.
I am widowed by the loss of the
higher half of your entity. Can you not
see, Philip, it is not your views I combat,
your theory about humanitarianism and all
that? They are but the geometrical figures
of thought in your mind; and I have no
wish to disturb your &#8220;philosophic proposition.&#8221;
The point is, I love that in you
more than I love the lover. And the passion
with which you cling to it as something
apart from our relationship offends
me, excites forebodings. Tell me, are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
&#8220;philosophic propositions&#8221; alien to love?
And after all do you think you are the only
one who may claim them? This is a
secret,&mdash;I have a little diagram of feminine
wisdom hid away from you somewhere,
founded upon the wit of love. And we
shall see which lasts the longer, your
proposition or my understanding!</p>
<p>But I must not forget to speak of a
matter much more practical just now.
You mentioned the letter that you sent
to father,&mdash;&#8220;The contents you might imagine
even if he did not show it to you.&#8221;
Well, he did not show it to me, but
from the effect it produced upon him I am
obliged to infer that it contained the most
iniquitous blasphemies. Philip, I do hope
you are not subject to fits of &#8220;righteous
indignation!&#8221; I could welcome a season
of secular rage in a man as I could a fierce
wind in sultry weather, but this kind of
fury that cloaks itself in the guise of outraged
piety is very trying. No sooner did
father read your letter than he strode in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
upon me like a grey-bearded firebrand.
The offending letter was crushed in his
hand, and his glasses were akimbo on his
nose, the way they always are when he is
perturbed. I spare you the details, but
from the nature of his questions you might
have thought he was examining you
through me for a licence to preach. I did
not try to deceive him in regard to your
views, but my own impression of them
is so nebulous that the very vagueness of
my replies increased his alarm. Nor did I
protest at the abuse he heaped upon your
absent head. For I know how wickedly
and unscrupulously you acted in the felony
of my love, and there was a certain humorous
satisfaction in hearing father give
a &#8220;philosophic proposition&#8221; to your criminality.
My only prayer was that he might
not ask me if I loved you. Philip, I would
rather live on bread and water a week than
confess it to any living man besides yourself.
But father has dwelt too long outside the
realm of romance to ask that very natural
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
question. Finally I protested feebly: &#8220;But
how can it vitally affect a woman&#8217;s happiness
whether or not her husband accepts
the doctrine of repentance just as you do?
Can he not love and cherish his wife even
if he does question the veracity of Jonah&#8217;s
whaling experience?&#8221; But when I looked
up and saw his face, I was ashamed, and
ran and kissed him, and straightened his
glasses so that he could see me with both
eyes. But, dear Heart, his eyes were too
full of tears to fire upon me. And as I sat
there upon the arm of his chair, twisting
his sacred beard, this is what he told me.
When my mother died, he said, and left
me a little puckered pink mite in his arms,
he had solemnly dedicated me to God.
And he declared, moreover, that he could
not be faithless to his vow by giving me
in marriage to an infidel. Being an infidel,
Philip, is much worse than being a plain
heathen; an infidel is a heathen raised to
the sixteenth power of iniquity! Now I
rarely quote Scripture, for I have too much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
guile in me to justify the liberty, but I
could not refrain from mentioning Abraham&#8217;s
dilemma, it seemed so appropriate
to the occasion,&mdash;how when he was about
to offer up Isaac, he saw a little he-goat
suggestively nearby fastened among the
thorns; and I suggested that instead of
sacrificing me he should take the widow
Smith&#8217;s little Johnnie, who shows even at
this early Sabbath-school age a pharisaical
aptitude for piety. I pointed out that in
the sight of heaven one soul is as worthy,
as acceptable, as another. Besides, did not
Isaac become a righteous man, even if he
was not offered up and did live in this
world of temptations an unconscionably
long time? But father was not to be
reasoned with or comforted. And yesterday,
Sunday, he preached impressively
from the text, &#8220;Why do the heathen rage
and the people imagine a vain thing? &#8221;Of
course <i>you</i> are the heathen, Philip, and of
course <i>I</i> am the &#8220;vain thing.&#8221; But that is
not father&#8217;s idea. The vain thing you imagine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
is that he will give his consent to
our marriage! Well, you may settle it
between you! All I know is that now I
am predestined, but not in the dedicated
deaconess direction!</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Jessica, the Brave</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;What do you think, <i>our</i> little forest
is for sale. And oh, Philip, if some
vandal buys my dear trees and cuts them
down, my very life will die of grief! They
are my brothers. And if a man built a
house there and asked me to marry him, I
would, if he were as ugly as old Jeremiah!
(I suppose all the prophets were like this,
their writings produce that impression!)
And my father would consent, even if the
bridegroom were a heathen instead of a
prophet. For he would be obliged to attend
religious services at Morningtown,
and father does not believe any man can
long remain under the drippings of his
sanctuary without being forgiven. And I
do not either. God would have mercy
upon him somehow!

<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>PHILIP TO JESSICA</p>
</div>

<p>Your letter, dearest Jessica, and your
father&#8217;s came by the same post, and the
sensation they gave me was as if some
moral confusion had befallen the elements
and summer were mingled with winter in
the same sky. Not that his letter was anything
but kind and dignified, but it seemed
to remove you and your life so far away
from me. I confess I had some fears that
he might insist on the little we have seen
or, as the world judges, know of each
other; it had not occurred to me that my
&#8220;infidelity&#8221; would block my path to happiness&mdash;so
little do the people I commonly
meet reck of that matter. I have been accusing
the world all along of indifference to
the spirit and to theology, and now, by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
sort of poetical irony, I am blocked in my
progress toward happiness by meeting one
who adheres to an old-world belief in
these things. The burden of his reply
was in these words: &#8220;I cannot conceive
that my daughter should give her heart to
a man who was not strong in the faith in
which she has herself been nurtured. I
would gladly be otherwise convinced, but
from all I can learn you are of those who
trust rather in the pride of intellect than in
the humility of Christian faith. &#8221;Why, my
fair Jesuit, have you concealed your love
as well as this! I think no one could live
in the same house with me without hearing
the bird that sings in my breast. You
must tell your father the whole truth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I will write to him as best I
can, but the real debate I must leave until
I come to Morningtown. And how shall I
persuade him that I have faith or that my
faith is in any way an equivalent for his
belief in the Christian dogma? Will he
listen to me if I say that a man may believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
the whole catechism and yet have no faith?
Mankind, as I regard them, are divided into
two pretty distinct classes: those to whom
the visible world is real and the invisible
world unreal or at best a shadow of the visible,
and those to whom this visible realm
with all its life is mere illusion whereas the
spirit alone is the eternal reality. Faith is
just this perception of the illusion enwrapping
all these phenomena that to those
without faith seem so real; faith is the voluntary
turning away of the spirit from this
illusion toward the infinite reality. It is because
I find among the men of to-day no
perception of this illusion that I deny the
existence of faith in the world. It is because
men have utterly lost the sense of
this illusion that religion has descended into
this Simony of the humanitarians. How
shall I tell your father this? I think we
should do better to discuss household
economy than religion.</p>
<p>Just now I am forcibly detained in New
York by a number of petty duties, but in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
few days I shall set forth on my second pilgrimage
to Morningtown. Shall I have
any wit to persuade your father that my
&#8220;infidelity&#8221; is not the unpardonable sin,
or that my love for you is sufficient to
cover even that sin and a host of others?
And how will Jessica meet me? She will
not look now, I trust, for that cloven hoof
which I never had and those ass&#8217;s ears
which, alas! I did flourish so portentously.
Why, Jessica, according to your
own words you will have a strange double
lover to greet, and I think it would be
mathematically correct if you gave two
kisses in return for every one. It will be a
new rendering of Catullus&#8217;s <i>Da Basia</i>.</p>
<p>And so your little forest is for sale.
Could I buy that faerie land, sweetheart,
and build therein a hidden house and over
its threshold carry a sweet bride! Ah,
you have rewritten the sacred story of
Eden. Not for the love of woman should
I be driven from the happy garden, but
brought by woman&#8217;s grace from the desert
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
into the circle of perfect Paradise. Together
we should hearken to the singing
of birds; together, we should bend over
the bruised flowers and look up into the
green majesty of the trees; and sometimes,
it might be, as we walked together hand
in hand in the cool of the evening,&mdash;sometimes,
it might be, we should hear the
voice of our own happiness speaking to us
from the shadows and deem that it was
God. May angels and ministers of grace
enfold you in their mercy for this dream of
rapture you have given me! It shall feed
my imagination in dreams until I come to
you and learn in your arms the more &#8220;sober
certainty of waking bliss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, withal, would you be willing to
forego your &#8220;brothers,&#8221; as you call the
trees, and this vision of hidden peace?
Would it pain you to leave them and come
with me into this great solitude of people
which we call New York? How in that
idyllic retreat should I keep my heart and
mind on the stern purpose I have set before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
me? There, indeed, the world and all the
concerns of mankind would sink so far
from my care, would fade into the mist of
such utter illusion, that I know not how I
could write with seriousness about them.
I need not the happiness of love&#8217;s isolation,
but the rude contact of affairs, yet with
love&#8217;s encouragement, to hold me within
practical ideas. So it seems to me now,
but I would not mar the beauty of your
life. Of this and many more things we
will talk together when I come.</p>
<p>I have given up my old comfortable
quarters in the&mdash;&mdash;and have taken a couple
of cheap rooms here at&mdash;&mdash;. For some
months I shall not be writing for money
and I wished not to eat unnecessarily into
my small savings. One room is a mere
closet where I sleep, the other is pretty
large, but still crowded immoderately with
my books. I am hard at work on a book
I have had in mind for several years,&mdash;the
history and significance of humanitarianism.
I need not tell you what the gist of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
that <i>magnum opus</i> is to be, and, dear sceptic,
trust me it will be put into such a form
as to stir up a pother whether with or
without ultimate results. I have learned
enough from the despised trade of journalism
to manage that. When I return from
Morningtown I shall give myself up utterly
to composition. Two or three months
ought to suffice for the work, for the material
is already well in hand; and at the
end of that time my pen shall turn to making
money again. I have no anxiety about
gaining a modest income&mdash;and can you
imagine what that means to you and me?</p>
<p>I had thought to send our goblin boy
into the country as you bade me, but for a
while I am keeping him here. He sleeps
in a cot beside me, and in the day, when
not at school or crouching in sphinxlike
silence on the curbstone, he sits in a great
chair by the window. Often when I look
up from my book his eyes are fixed on me
with a kind of mute appealing wonder.
Somehow I could not let him go. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
seems a link between us in our separation;
and while my thoughts are set upon rebuking
the errors of humanitarianism it will
be well to have this object of human pity
before my eyes.</p>
<p>I wonder if you comprehend what a
strange wistful letter you have written.
You are no longer merely the maid I knew,
and my ways of thought excite in you a
terror of loneliness that sharpens into resentment&mdash;so
you say. Once more, dear
girl, we will talk of all this when I come.
Until that happy day, wait, and fortify your
love with trust.

<p style=' margin-top:2em;'>XXXIV</p>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>JESSICA TO PHILIP</p>
</div>

<p>I have a number of terms, my Philip,
with which I might begin this letter, but I
have not yet the courage to call you by
such dear names beyond the whispering
gallery of my own heart.</p>
<p>And you wonder how I have concealed
my romantic deflections from father. Indeed,
I am sure he has noticed a heavenly-mindedness
in me for some time past; but
out of the sanctity of his own heart he
probably attributed this improvement to the
chastening effects of a particularly gloomy
course of religious reading that he has insisted
upon my undertaking this winter.
And, after all, father is not so far wrong as to
my spiritual state, for when love becomes a
woman&#8217;s vocation, she carries blessings in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
her eyes and all her moods tiptoe reverently
like young novices who follow one
another down a cathedral aisle. This life
of the heart becomes her piety, I think, and
the highest form of religion of which she is
capable. Jessica begins to magnify herself,
you see! A kingdom of heaven has been
set up within me, dear creator, and naturally
I feel this extension of my boundaries.</p>
<p>But do not expect me to tell father &#8220;the
whole truth,&#8221;&mdash;how you first fascinated
me with editorial magnanimity, then baited
me with compliments, and later with deepest
confidences, and finally slipped into my
Arcadia disguised as a philosopher, but,
when you had got entire possession, declared
yourself a victorious lover! I wonder
that you can contemplate the record
you have made in this matter without
blushing!</p>
<p>As for your &#8220;infidelity,&#8221; and what you
call your &#8220;faith,&#8221; I think father will denounce
them both as blasphemous. Religion
to father is something more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
&#8220;the poetry he believes in.&#8221; It has the
definition of experience, miracles, and a
whole body of spiritual phenomena quite
as real to him as your upper-chamber existence
is to you. Only father has this
advantage of you, he has a real Divinity,
with all the necessary attributes of a man&#8217;s
God. His &#8220;voice of happiness&#8221; speaks to
him from the stars, and he does not call it
an echo, as you do, of a fair voice within
your own heart. Father gets his salvation
from the outside of his warring elements;
you speak to your own seas, &#8220;Peace be
still!&#8221; As for me, between you, I stand
winking at Heaven; and I say: &#8220;It is evident
that neither of them understands this
mystery of life; I will not try to comprehend.
I will be good when I can, and
diplomatic when I must, and leave the rest
to heaven and earth and nature.&#8221; Meanwhile,
I advise you not to quote your
pagan authorities to father. If the very
worst comes, you may say that you have
almost scriptural proof of my affections,&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
mind you say affections, father could
not bear the romantic inflection of such a
term as love. It sounds too secular, carnal,
to him.</p>
<p>You ask me if I will consent to abandon
such a life as our forest offers and come
with you into &#8220;this great solitude of people&#8221;
which you call New York. Philip,
when a man holds a starling in his hand he
does not ask the bird whether it will stay
here or wing yonder, but he carries it with
him where he will; and the starling sings,
no less in one place than in another, because
its nature is to sing. But, I think,
dear Master, the motive which prompts the
song in the cage is not the same as the
impulse to sing in the forest. So it is
with me. If we live here among the trees,
where their green waves make a summer sea
high in the heavens above our heads, I could
be as content as any bird is. But if you
make our home in the city, or in the midst
of a desert for that matter, I could not withhold
one thought from your happiness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
for love has transformed me, adapted life
itself to a new purpose. I have been
&#8220;called,&#8221; and I have no will to resist, because
my heart tells me there is goodness
in the purpose, a little necklace of womanly
virtues for me. When I think of pain, and
sorrow, my eyes are holden, I can see only
the fair form of love sanctified, and I can
hear only your voice calling me to fulfil a
destiny which you yourself do not understand.
And as all these things approach,
beloved, father&#8217;s God is more to me than
your fine illusion. I wish for guardian angels,
I feel the need of a Virgin Mary and
of all the lady mothers in heaven to bless
me.</p>
<p>But I have been telling you only of my
inner life. Outwardly I shall ever be capable
of the most heathen manifestations.
For instance, loving as I do, how do you
account for this personal animosity I feel
toward you, almost a madness of fear at
the thought of your approaching visit?
There is something that has never been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
finished in this affair of our hearts. Perhaps
it is that really you have never kissed
me. Well, I find it as easy to write of
kisses as to review a sentimental romance,
but actually there is some instinct in me
stronger than mind against the fact, do you
understand? Philip, you have no idea of
the depths of feminine treachery! Did I
ever intimate a willingness to do such a
thing? I do not say that I <i>wish</i> to kiss
another, but I affirm that it would be easier
for me to kiss my father&#8217;s presiding elder&mdash;and
heaven knows he is a didactic monster
of head and whiskers! It is not that I
do not love you, but that I do!</p>
<p>Do you know what will happen when
you come to Morningtown? I will meet
you at the station, not as Jessica, but as
the demure little home-made daughter of
the Methodist minister here; we will greet
each other with blighting formality, for
there will be the station-master&#8217;s wife to
observe us; we will walk home along the
main street, and we will speak of the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
trivial or useful subjects, of the weather in
New York, and of Jack more particularly.
Out of sheer bravado I will scan your face
now and then, but my eyes will not rest
there long enough to fall before yours discomfited.
When we reach the house father
will greet you from his Sinai elevation, with
pretty much the same holy-man courtesy
Moses would have showed if a heathen
Canaanite had appeared to him. And while
you two are exchanging platitudes, I will
escape into this room of mine, take one
glance at my mirror, and then cover my
face with my hands for joy and shame
while the red waves of love mount as high
as they will over it. Ah, Philip, I shall be
<i>so</i> glad to see you, and so afraid! But you
shall have small satisfaction in either fact,
for I do not aim to make it easy for you to
win what is already yours in my heart.</p>
<hr />

<p>P.S.&mdash;So you are keeping Jack mured

wonder he &#8220;crouches in sphinxlike silence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
on the curbstone.&#8221; He prefers it to your
company. You once told me that you
found humanitarians difficult to live with:
I wonder what Jack thinks of mystical
philosophers in the domestic relation. It
almost brings tears to my eyes. And some
day in a similar situation I may be driven to
seek the cold curbstone for companionship.

</div>

<p>It seems to me as I read your letters, my
sweet wife to be, that I am only beginning
to learn the richness of my fortune. And
will you not, when you write to me next
time&mdash;will you not call me by one of
those dear names that you speak in the
whispering gallery of your heart? I shall
barely receive more than one letter from
you now before I come to see you in person
and tell over with you face to face the
story of our love. Just a few more days
and I shall be free.</p>
<p>But for the present I want to talk to you
about Jack. Indeed, I feel a little sore on
this point. It was you who proposed our
adopting him, yet, after your first words
of advice, you have left me to work out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
the situation quite unaided; and now I can
see that you are laughing at me. Poor
Jack, he was something like a &#8220;philosophical
proposition&#8221; which I had never
very thoroughly analysed. One thing, however,
begins to grow perfectly clear: my
home is no place for him; he is only a
shadow in my life and needs to take on
substance. Well, I thought at last I had
solved the problem&mdash;or at least that
O&#8217;Meara had solved it for me; but here
too I was disappointed. Really, you must
help me out of this muddle.</p>
<p>Do you remember the note-book of
O&#8217;Meara&#8217;s that I told you about? Ever
since his death I have been too busy really
to look through the volume; but day before
yesterday it occurred to me that I
might find some information there about
Jack&#8217;s parentage, and with that end in
view I spent most of the day deciphering
the smeared pages. At first I found everything
in the notes except what I wanted,
but toward the end of the book I discovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
a whole group of memoranda and
reflections in which the name Tarrytown
occurred again and again. I will read you
the notes when I come; without giving
many events they tell in a disjointed way
a little idyllic episode in the story of his
life. He, too, knew love, and was loved.
There in that village by the Hudson for a
few short months he kept the enemy at
bay and was happy. And then, too soon,
came the fatal story&mdash;the only dated note
in the book, I believe:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>September 3d: A son was born and she has left me
to care for him alone. I had thought that happiness
might endure, and this too was illusion. I stand by
the tomb and read the graven words: <i>Et ego in Arcadia
fui</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>And so, yesterday, on a venture I took
our little goblin boy with me to Tarrytown,
and after some inquiry found that
his mother&#8217;s relations were farm people
living on the outskirts of the town. They
proved to have been poor but respectable
people. At present only the grandfather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
is living alone in the house, and he is very
feeble. He was willing to assume the care
of Jack, but I cannot persuade myself to
leave the child in those trembling hands.
Indeed, when it comes to the issue, I cannot
quite decide to let him go entirely from
me, for is he not one of the ties that bind
me to you? I have brought him back
with me to New York&mdash;which will only
increase your merriment at my expense.</p>
<p>Some day when you have come to live
in New York&mdash;if this is to be our home&mdash;we
will go together up the river to Tarrytown,
and you shall see the land where
O&#8217;Meara dreamed his dream of happiness
and where your adopted child was born.</p>
<p>And when we go there, I will take you
to a bowered nook overhanging the river,
where I passed the afternoon reading and
thinking of many things. There together
we will sit in the shadow of the trees and
talk and plan together how <i>our</i> happiness,
at least, shall be made to endure; and you
shall teach me to lose this haunting sense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
of illusion in the great reality of love. And
as the evening descends and twilight steals
upon the ever-flowing water, I will take
you in my arms a moment, and this shall
be my vow: God do so to me and more
also, if any darkness falls from my life
upon yours, until our evening, too, has
come and the light of this world passes
quietly into the dream that lies beyond.</p>
<p>All this I thought yesterday while I sat
alone and read once more the sad record
of O&#8217;Meara&#8217;s ruin. He did not stay long
in Tarrytown, it seems, after his loss, but
came back to New York, bringing Jack
with him, in the hope that this care might
keep him from the old disgrace. Alas,
and alas, you know the end! Sometimes
apparently the vision of those peaceful
days returned to him with piercing sweetness.
Above all he associated them&mdash;so
one may surmise from a number of memoranda&mdash;with
a new meaning he began to
discover in his beloved Virgil. For, somehow,
the story of the <i>Æneid</i> became a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
symbol to him of the illusion of life. Especially
the last bewildered, shadowy fight
of Turnus, driven by some inner frenzy to
his destruction, grew to be the tragedy of
his own fall. Many verses from those
books he quotes with comments only too
clear. And is there not a touch of strange
pathos in this memory of his summer
joy?&mdash;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>There the meaning of the <i>Georgics</i> was opened to me
as it never was before. The stately lines of precept and
the sunny pictures of the <i>l&oelig;tas segetes</i> seemed to connect
themselves with the smiling scenes about us. The
little village lay among broad farm-checkered hills, and
the garden behind my house stretched back to the brow
of a deep slope. In the cool shadows of the beech trees
that edged this hill I used to lie and read through the
long summer mornings; and often I would look up from
the page, disturbed by the hoarse cawing of the crows
as they flew up from the woods or fields nearby and
flapped heavily across the valley. The effect of their
flight was simple, but laid hold on the imagination in a
peculiar manner. As they flew in a horizontal line the
sloping hillside appeared to drop away beneath them
like the subsiding of a great wave. It was just the
touch needed to add a sense of mystic instability to the
earth and to subtilise the prosaic farmland into the realm
of illusion. Looking at the fields in this glorified light
I first understood the language of the poet:</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'><i>Flumina amem silvasque inglorius</i>,</p>
</td></tr></table>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>and his pathetic envy of those</p>
</div>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Too happy husbandmen, if but they knew</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>The wonders of their state!</p>
</td></tr></table>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>And when wearied of this wider scene I turned to
the garden itself, still I was in Virgil&#8217;s haunted world.
Some distance from the house was a group of apple
trees, under whose protecting branches stood a row
of beehives; and nearby, in a tiny rustic arbor, I could
sit through many a golden hour and read, while the
hum of bees returning home with their burden of honey
sounded in my ears. It was there I learned to enjoy
the <i>levium spectacula rerum</i>, as he calls the story of
his airy tribes; and there in that great quiet of nature,&mdash;so
wide and solemn that it seemed a reproach
against the noisy activities of men,&mdash;I learned what
the poet meant to signify in those famous lines with
which he closes his account of the warring bees:</p>
</div>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>These mighty battles, all this tumult of the breast,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>With but a little scattered earth are brought to rest.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>In this way Jack&#8217;s father learned the illusion
of life by looking back on his happy
days. I did not mean to fill my letter with
this long extract from his note-book, nor
would I end with such ill-omened words.
Dear girl, I too have learned the deception
of life in other ways. Teach me, when I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
come to you, the great reality. In all
O&#8217;Meara&#8217;s memoranda after his return to
New York I could find only a single direct
allusion to the woman he loved. It was
very brief: &#8220;On this day two years ago
she said I made her happy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Shall I bring happiness to you when I
come?

</div>

<p>JESSICA TO PHILIP. WRITTEN BEFORE THE RECEIPT
OF THE PRECEDING LETTER FROM PHILIP</p>
<p>Think of this,&mdash;I love you, but I do not
know you. I only know your heart, your
mind, that part of you which meets me in
spirit like the light from some distant star
that slips across my window sill at evening.
But you, oh! Philip, I do not know
<i>you</i>. You are a stranger whom I have
seen only twice in my life. Do not be
angry, my beloved, I do love you; but
cannot you understand that I must get
used to the idea of your being some one
very real? These are thoughts forced upon
me by your approaching visit, and so I
ask a favour: Do not tell me when to expect
you. If you threaten me with the
identical day of your coming, I will vanish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
from the face of the earth! But if you
come upon me unawares, I shall have been
spared that consciousness of <i>confession</i> face
to face involved by a deliberate welcome.
And if you come thus, I shall not have
time to retire behind my instinctive defence
against you. You see that I plan in
your favour, that I wish to be unrestrainedly
glad when you come.</p>
<p>And about the kisses, you understand of
course, dear Philip, that I am incapable
of determining them really! I only contemplated
the possibility when distance
made it an impossibility. Still, you cannot
fail to know that I love you, that it
would even break my heart if you did not
come! For, Philip, a woman&#8217;s heart is
like the Scriptures, apparently full of contradictions,
but really it is the symbol of
our everlasting truth, if only you have the
wisdom to understand it.</p>
<p>And another thing, Philip, the more I
think of it, the more I am scandalised by
the way you drag that poor goblin child
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
about. My heart yearns for him and his
solitude in the midst of your philosophies.
You have made a perfect jumping-jack of
him for your lordly amusement, and it
isn&#8217;t fair. Bring him with you to Morningtown.
I charge you. And remember,
don&#8217;t lose him or philosophise him out of
existence on the way. I have talked with
father about the boy, and he is primed
with religious zeal to snatch this tender
brand from your burning.

<p>Just a note, sweet lady, to bid you expect
me on the afternoon train Thursday&mdash;and
is not that a long while from to-day?
And please do not come to the station.
I would not have our meeting chilled by
the curious eyes of that station-master&#8217;s
wife; I remember the scrutiny of her gaze
too well. And as for our greeting&mdash;you
have made a very pretty story out of that,
but have you not omitted Philip from the
account? Is it not just possible that he
may mar all Jessica&#8217;s nicely laid plans? I
have a suspicion that, in his crude masculine
way, he may prefer to translate into
fact what Jessica finds so easy to contemplate
in words. I feel a bit uncertain as
to how he will behave as a lover; the rôle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
is new to him, and he may be awkward
and a bit vehement.</p>
<p>Yes, I will bring Jack and leave him to
be brooded under your kind maternal feathers.
You will love him for the pathos of
his eyes and for his quaint ways.</p>

<p>WRITTEN ON RETURNING FROM HIS VISIT TO
MORNINGTOWN</p>
<p>Here I am back in my own room, in this
solitude of books; and how different is
this home-coming from that other when
I brought with me only bitterness and
despair!</p>
<p>Shall I tell you, sweetheart, some of the
things I learned during my three days in
Morningtown? First of all, I discovered
that you are clothed with wonderful beauty.
In a dim way I knew this before, but the
full mystery of your loveliness was not revealed
to me until this third time. Can it
be that love has transformed you a little and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
added grace to grace, or is it only my
vision that has been purged of its earthly
dulness? I could love a homely woman
whose spirit was fair, but to love one who
is altogether beautiful, in whose perfect
grace I can find no spot or blemish&mdash;that is
the miracle of my blessedness. There was
a strange light in your eyes that haunts me
yet. Such a light I have seen on a lonely
pool when the evening sunlight slanted
upon it from over the brown hills of autumn,
but nowhere else. My soul would
bathe in that pure water and be baptised
into the new faith.</p>
<p>For my faith, of which I boasted so valiantly,
has changed since I have seen you.
Faith, I had thought, was a form of insight
into the illusion of earthly things, of transient
joys and fears. And always a little
dread would creep into my heart lest love,
too, should prove to be such an illusion,
the last great deception of all, binding the
bewildered soul in a web of phantom desires.
So I still felt as I walked with you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
that first evening out into the circle of your
trees. And there, dear Jessica, in the
waiting silence and the grey shadows of
that seclusion I put my arms about you
and would have drawn you to my heart.
Ah, shall I not remember the wild withdrawing
of your eyes as I stooped over
your face! And then with a cry of defiance
and one swift bound, you tore yourself
loose from me and ran like a frightened
dryad deeper into the forest. That was a
mad chase, and forever and forever I shall
see your lithe form darting on before me
through the mingled shadow and light.
And when at last I caught you and held you
fast, shall I not remember how you panted
and fluttered against me like a bird in the
first terror of captivity! And then, suddenly,
you were still, and looked up into my
face, and in your eyes I beheld the wonder
of a strange mystery which no words can
name. Only I knew that my dread was
forever at end. It was for a second&mdash;nay,
an eternity, I think&mdash;as if we two were rapt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
out of the world, out of ourselves, into
some infinite abysm of life. It was as if
the splendour of the apocalypse broke upon
us, and poured upon our eyes the ineffable
whiteness of heaven. I knew in that instant
that love is not an illusion, but the one
reality, the one power that dispels illusion,
the very essence of faith. I shuddered
when the vision passed; but its memory
shall never fade. So much I learned on
that day.</p>
<p>And I also learned, or thought I learned,
that your father&#8217;s real objection to my suit
lay not so much in his hostility to my views,
as in his fear of losing you out of his life. And
as I talked with him, even plead with him,
I was filled with pity and with something
like remorse for the sorrow I was to bring
upon his heart. He is a saint, dear Love,
but very human. You have said that I
acted like a robber toward you. I could
smile at your fury, but to your father I do
indeed play the robber&#8217;s part. Yet in the
end I think he will learn to trust me and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
will give me the one jewel he treasures in
this world. Shall a man do more than this?
It is hard to remain in this uncertainty, but
our love at least is all our own.

<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>JESSICA TO PHILIP</p>
</div>

<p>I have just received your letter, dear
lover, and as I read it, all my lilies changed
once more to roses&mdash;as they did, you remember
how often, while you were here.
This is your miracle, my Philip, for in the
South you know we do not have the brilliant
colour so noticeable in your Northern
women. But now I have only to think of
you, to whisper your name, to recall something
you said or did, and immediately I feel
the red rose of love burn out on cheek and
brow. Indeed, I think it was this magic
of colour that made the difference in my appearance
which seems to have mystified you.</p>
<p>And will it please you to learn that at the
end of each day, as the shadows begin to
crowd down upon the world, I keep a tryst
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
with you beneath the old Merlin oak where
you first clasped me breathless and terrified
in your arms? (Be sure, dear Heart,
on this account, he will be the first sage in
the forest to wear a green beard of bloom
next spring!) And each time the memory
of that moment, which began in such
fright for me, and ended in such rapture for
us both, rushes over me, I wonder that I
could ever have feared the man whom I
love. But you must not infer from this
that I can be prodigal of my kisses. Only,
in the future, I shall have a saner reason for
withholding them,&mdash;that of economy. For
if frugality is ever wise, and extravagance
forever foolish, it must be true in love as
in the less romantic experiences of life.</p>
<p>And now I have a sensation for you, Mr.
Towers. Now that love has finished me, I
have found my real self once more. I am
no longer the bewildered woman, embarrassed
by a thousand new sensations, lost
in the maze of your illusions, but I am Jessica
again, as remote from you, by moods,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
as the little green buds that swing high
upon the boughs of these trees, wrapped yet
in their brown winter furs. I mean that
now I am able even to detach my thoughts
from you at will and to live with the sort
of personal emphasis I had before I knew
you. I think it is because at last I am so
sure of you that I can afford to forget you!
How do you like that?</p>
<p>Besides, are we not now a part of the
natural order, and does not everything there
hint of a divine progression? The trees
will be covered soon with the fairy mist of
a new foliage, and our earth sanctified with
many a little pageant of flowers. Goodness
and happiness are foreordained. No
real harm can befall us, now that we belong
to this heavenly procession. All our days
will come to pass, like the seasons of the
year, inevitably. There is no longer any
escape from our dear destiny. And as for
me, dear Philip, I think there are already
hopes enough in my heart to grow a green
wreath about my head by next spring!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Jack is very well, but still a little foreigner
in this land where there is so much
space between things, so many wide
sweeps of brown meadow for him to stretch
his narrow street faculties across. He is
silent but acquisitive, so I do not tease him
with too many explanations. He will be
happier for learning all these mysteries of
nature herself, as he watches the miracle of
new life now about to begin on the earth.
Occasionally, however, when an unbidden
thought of you makes it imperative that
some one should be kissed, I sweep him
up into my arms rapturously, and bestow
my alms upon his brow. But if you could
see the nonchalance, the prosaic indifference
with which he endures these caresses,
you <i>could</i> not be jealous!

<p>I have always known, dear Love, that the
first gentleman was a gardener and that all
men hanker after that blissful state of Adam
whose only toil was to care for the world&#8217;s
early-blooming flowers. But what was
our first great parent to me?</p>

<p>and I, even I, by some magic skill of commutation,
am able to change the one bloom
into the other. Was it not the rising colour
on Cynthia&#8217;s cheek that the poet described
as &#8220;rose leaves floating in the purest
milk&#8221;? And was it not Keats (or who
was it?) who vowed he could &#8220;die of a
rose in aromatic pain&#8221;? I could write an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
anthology on Jessica Blushing; indeed I
could hardly otherwise be so pleasantly and
virtuously employed as in going through the
poets and bringing together all that they
have said in prophecy of your many divine
properties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you have turned me into a
poet myself&mdash;think of that!&mdash;me, for these
dozen years a musty, cobwebbed groper in
philosophies and religions! I have been
sitting here by my fire for hours, smoking
and dreaming and rhyming, rhyming and
dreaming and smoking; and pretty soon
the rumble of the first milk-waggons will
come up from the street, and with that
prosaic summons I shall go to bed when
thrifty folk are beginning to yawn under the
covers and think of the day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>I wonder sometimes if my inveterate
pedantries do not amuse or, worse yet,
bore you. I am grown so used to books
and the language of books. I believe
when Gabriel blows his trump I shall start
up from my long slumber with a Latin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
quotation on my lips&mdash;<i>At tuba terribili</i>,
like as not. (Query: Does Gabriel understand
Latin, or is Hebrew your only celestial
speech?)</p>
<p>I am trying to be facetious, but really the
matter worries me a little. Have you been
laughing at me because I scolded you for
neglecting your Latin, and because I took a
copy of Catullus in my pocket when we
made our Sunday excursion into the woods?
Yet it was all so sweet to me. In the air
hovered the first premonitions of spring,
and the sunlight poured down upon the
earth like an intoxicating wine that has
been chilled in the cellar but is golden yellow
with the glow of an inner fire. And
some day I must set up an inscription on
that Merlin oak over the nook where
we sat together and talked and read, and
ceased from words when sweeter language
was required. As you leaned back against
the warm, dry leaves I had piled up, with
your great cloak twisted about your body&mdash;all
except your feet, that would creep out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
into the sun, tantalising me with a thousand
forbidden thoughts&mdash;I understood
how the old Greeks dreamed of dryads,
fairer than mortal women, who haunted the
forests. It pains me almost to think of that
hour; I cannot fathom the meaning of so
much beauty; a dumb fear comes upon me
lest you should fade from my life like an
aërial vision and leave me unsatisfied. Yet
you seemed very real that day, and your
lips had all the fragrance of humanity.</p>
<p>Was it not characteristic of me that I
could not revel in that present bliss without
seeking some warrant for my joy in ancient
poetry? To read of Catullus and his passion
while your heart throbbed against my
hand seemed to lend a profounder reality to
my own love. Dear dryad of the groves,
yet womanly warm, because inevitably I
connect my emotions with the hopes and
fears of many poets who have trod the paths
of Paradise before me, because I translate
my thoughts into their passionate words,
you must not therefore suppose that something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
fantastic and inhuman clings to my
love for you. The deeper my feelings, the
more certainly do they clothe themselves
in all that my reading has garnered of rare
and beautiful. Other men woo with flowers;
I would adorn you also with every
image and comparison of grace that the
mind of man has conceived. The more
fully my love invades every faculty of my
soul and body, the more certain is it to assume
for its own uses the labour and learning
of my brain. You see I am welded
more than I could believe into a feminine
unity by your mystic touch, and that masculine
duality of which I spoke is passing
away. With some trepidation I write out
for you these half-borrowed verses:</p>

</div>

<p>A letter from my lover, so like him that
it is the dearest message I have ever had
from him. In this mood you are nearest
akin to my heart. For if love fills my mind
with a thousand woodland images, it sends
you back to the classic groves of the ancients,
where the wings of a bird might
measure off destiny to a lover in an hexameter
of light across his morning, and
where the whole world was full of sweet
oracles. The truth is we have need of an
old Latin deity now. There was a romantic
sympathy between the Olympian dynasty
of gods and common men, more vital than
our ascetic piety. And there are some
experiences so essentially pagan that no
other gods can afford to bless them!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>Indeed, since your departure I have found
a sort of occult companionship with you
in reading once more some of the old
Latin poets. Father is gratified, for he
thinks that after all I may sober into a
Christian scholarship with the old Roman
monks, and to this end he will tolerate
even Catullus. But really the wisdom of
love has given me a keener appreciation
of these sweet classics. Did you ever
think how wonderful is the youth, the
simplicity, the morning freshness of all
their thoughts. It is we moderns who
have grown old, pedantic; and when some
lyrical experience, such as love, suddenly
rejuvenates us, drawing us back into the
primal poetic consciousness, then we turn
instinctively to these ancients for an interpretation
of our hearts,&mdash;also because their
definition of beauty, which is always the
garment Love wears, is better than we can
make now. With us &#8220;The Beautiful&#8221; is
often mere cant, or a form of sentimentality,
but with them it was a principle, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
spirtual faculty that determined all proportions.
Thus their very philosophies show a
beautiful formality, a Parthenon entrance to
life. And from first to last they never left
the gay amorous gods of nature out of
their thoughts. This is a relief, a tender
companionship, that we have lost from our
prosaic world. You see Jessica grows
&#8220;pedantic&#8221; also! The poem you sent has
awakened in me these reflections. The
words of it slipped into my heart as warm
as kisses.</p>
<p>But I have anxieties to tell you of. I fear
trouble is brewing for us in father&#8217;s prayer-closet.
You remember the little volume you
gave me, <i>The Forest Philosophers of India</i>?
Well, he found it last night in the library,
where I had inadvertently left it; and recognising
the author as the same dragon
who threatens the peace and piety of his
household, he settled himself vindictively
to reading it. The result exceeded my
worst fears. If his daughter were about
to become the hypnotised victim of an Indian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
juggler he would not be more alarmed.
He holds that all truth is based upon the
God idea. And he vows that you have attempted
to dissolve truth by detaching it
from this divine origin. You speak the
truth in other words, but you are accused
of blasphemously ignoring its sublime authorship.
Nor is that all. Your philosophy
must have gripped him hard, for he
declares that you have an abnormally
clairvoyant mind, and that &#8220;no female
intelligence&#8221; can long withstand the diabolical
influence of your heathen suggestions.
Really it made my flesh creep!
You might have thought he was warning
me against a snake charmer. And when
I declined to be alarmed, he locked himself
up in his closet to fast and pray. This is
the worst possible symptom in his case,
for he will work himself into a frenzy, and
before ever he eats or drinks he will get
&#8220;called&#8221; to take some radical stand against
us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, besides a growing affection
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
for Jack, I take a factitious interest in him
because he was your daily companion for
several months. I am tempted to ask him
many questions that are neither fair nor
modest, particularly as he is devoted to
you, and quite willing to talk of &#8220;Misther
Towers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he ever sing, Jack?&#8221; I began last
evening, as we sat alone before the library fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221;&mdash;Jack is laconic, but wise far
beyond his years in silent sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he often talk to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when we went for a walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me what about, Jackie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; was the ungrateful
revelation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you have forgotten!&#8221; I insinuated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never did know. He talks queer!&#8221;&mdash;I
tittered and Jack wrinkled up his face into
a funny little grimace. We both knew the
joke was on you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he ever mention any of his friends,&#8221;
I persevered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. Once he give me your love and
some things you sent,&#8221;&mdash;the little scamp
knew the direction of my curiosity!</p>
<p>&#8220;But did he never tell you anything
about me, Jackie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never did!&#8221;&mdash;I was wounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he like best?&#8221;&mdash;for I had
made up my mind to know the worst.</p>
<p>&#8220;His pipe,&#8221; he affirmed without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when he smoked he&#8217;d
lay back in his chair and stare at the
rings he made like they was somebody,
and once I saw him look jolly and kiss his
hand to &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! did you, Jack? then what did he
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Caught me looking at him, and told
me to go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean thing!&#8221; I comforted. &#8220;But
run along now and put the puppy to bed;
Mr. Towers was very rude to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was so happy I wished to be alone, for
no man, I am persuaded, ever smiled and
kissed his hand to Brahma. Dear Philip,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
if you only knew how jealous I am sometimes
of your Indian reveries, you would
understand how I could consider Jack&#8217;s
treacherous little revelation almost as an
answer to a prayer.

</div>

<p>Dear Jessica, you must not let the sins of
my youth find me out now and cast me
from Paradise. You alarm me for what
your father may think of that book of mine
on Oriental philosophy; I would not have
him take it with him into his prayer-closet
and there in that Star Chamber use it
against us in his determination of our suit.
Tell him, my Love, that I too have come to
see the folly of what I there wrote. Not
that anything in the book is false or that I
have discarded my opinion of the spiritual
supremacy of those old forest philosophers
of India, but I have come to see how unsuited
their principles of life must be for our
western world. They beheld a great gap
between the body and the spirit, and their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
remedy was, not to construct a bridge between
the two, but by some tremendous
and dizzy leap to pass over the yawning
gulf. We, to whom the life of the body is
so real, we who have devoted the whole
ingenuity of our mechanical civilisation to
the building up of a comfortable home for
that body, turn away from such spiritual
legerdemain with distrust, almost with terror.
A man among us to-day who would
take the religion of India as his guide is in
danger of losing this world without gaining
the other. No, our salvation, if it comes,
must come from Greece rather than from
India. Some day I shall write my recantation
and point out the way of salvation according
to the Gospel of Plato. Indeed,
since love has become a reality to me, I
have learned to read a new meaning in this
philosophy of reconciliation instead of renunciation.
Tell your father all this.
Some way we must bring this uncertainty
to an end. I must know that you are to be
my wife.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>And so Jack thinks a fuliginous pipe
holds the first place in my affections. The
little rascal! And why don&#8217;t you make that
precocious imp write to me? Do I not
stand to him <i>in loco parentis</i>? But, joking
aside, he does not know and you can
scarcely guess the full companionship of
my pipe these days. As the grey smoke
curls up about me in my abandonment,
(for I never even read during this sacramental
act,) there arises before my eyes in
that marvellous cloudland the image of
many wind-tossed trees down whose murmuring
avenue treads the vision of a dryad,
a woman; and as she moves the waving
boughs bend down and whisper: &#8220;Jessica,
sweet Jessica, he loves you; and when
our leaves appear and all things awake into
life, he will come to gather your sweetness
unto himself.&#8221;

XLII</p>
<p>JESSICA TO PHILIP
.ce end</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>It seems unnatural for me to address you
in this manner&mdash;as if I had cast off the
dearer part of myself by the formality. But
no other course is open to me after what
has happened.</p>
<p>After praying and fasting till I really
feared for his reason, father thinks he received
a direct answer from Heaven concerning
his duty toward us. He declares it
has been made absolutely clear to him that
if he deliberately gives his daughter in marriage
to one who will corrupt and destroy
her soul with &#8220;heathen mysticism,&#8221; his
own must pay the forfeit, and not only is
his personal damnation imminent, but his
ministry will become as sounding brass and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
tinkling cymbals of insincerity. He is entirely
convinced of the divine inspiration
of this revelation, and I am sure madness
would follow any resistance I might make.
I have therefore been obliged to promise
him that I will break our engagement and
end this correspondence, and I beg that you
will not make it harder for me by any protest,
either in person or letter. No appeal
can ever be made against a fanatic&#8217;s decision,
because it is based not upon reason, but
upon superstition, a sort of spiritual insanity
that becomes violent when opposed.</p>
<p>And father insists upon keeping Jack for
the same reason he preserves me from your
corrupting influence. He thinks the boy is
another little brand he has snatched from
your burning. And I hope you will consent
to his remaining with us, for he is a
great comfort now to my sad heart. He
will write to you, of course, for father cannot
but recognise that you have in a way a
prior authority over him.</p>
<p>Nothing more is to be said now that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
have the right to say. I have tried to take
refuge in the biologist&#8217;s definition of love,&mdash;that
it is essentially a fleeting emotion, a
phantom experience. It is like the blossoms
in May; to-day they are all about us,
making the whole earth an epic in colours,
to-morrow they are scattered in the dust,
lost in the gale. Just so I try to wish that
I may lose some memories, some tenderness
out of my heart. But I have not the
strength yet to take leave of all my glory
and happiness, nor can I say that I wish
you to forget,&mdash;only that it is best for us
both to forget now if we can.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Jessica</span>:</p>
<p>My first impulse on reading your letter
was to come immediately to Morningtown
and carry you away by storm; but second
thoughts have prevailed and I am writing
merely to bid you good-bye. For, after
all, if I came, what could I do? I would
not see you clandestinely and so mingle
deceit with our love, and I could not see
you in your father&#8217;s house while he feels as
he does. It would be fruitless too; you
have come to the meeting of ways and
have chosen. I think you have chosen
wrong, for the world belongs to the young
and not to the old. Life is ours with all
the prophecy and hopes of the future.
Ah, what mockery lurked in those words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
we read together in the shadow of your
beloved trees, while your heart lay in my
hands fluttering like a captive bird:</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>And now dear Love, only one phrase of all
that poem shall ring in my ears,&mdash;that
solemn <i>nox perpetua</i>, that long unending
night, for every joy you promised. Ah,
would you have thrust me away so easily
if I had not seemed to you wrapt up in a
strange shadow life into which no reality
of passion could enter? And was your
love, too, only a shadow? God help me
then! Yet I would not reproach you, for,
after all, the choice must have cost you a
weary pain. I have brought only misery
to you, and you have brought only misery
to me&mdash;and this is the fruit of love&#8217;s battle
with religion. Do you remember the story
of Iphigenia in Lucretius and that resounding
line, &#8220;So much of ill religion could
persuade&#8221;? Do you know Landor&#8217;s telling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
of that story, &#8220;O father! I am young and
very happy&#8221;? And so, our story has been
made one with the long tragedy of life and
of the poets; and the bitterness of all this
evil wrought by religion has troubled my
brain till I know not what to say. Only
this, sweet girl, that no tears of separation
and long waiting can wash away the love
I bear you. And, yes, I will not believe
that you can forget me. Come to me
when you will, now or many years hence,
and the chamber of my heart shall be garnished
and ready to receive you, the latch
hanging from the door, and within, on the
hearth, the fire burning unquenched and
unquenchable. Will you remember this?
There is no woman in the whole earth to
me, but Jessica. It will be so easy for me
to shut myself off from all the world, and
wait&mdash;wait, I say, and work. No, I think
you will not forget. There has grown
within me with love a mystic power to
which I can give no name. But I know
that in the long silences of the night while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
I sit reflecting after the day&#8217;s toil is done&mdash;that
something shall go forth from me to
you, and you shall turn restlessly in your
sleep and remember my kisses. And now
good-bye. Do not interpret anything I
have said as a rebuke. You are altogether
fair in my eyes, without spot or blemish,
and I would not exchange the pain you
have given me for the joys of a thousand
fleeting loves. And once again, good-bye.</p>

</div>

<p>I have been looking over her letters and
mine, steeping my soul in the bitterness of
its destiny; and what has impressed me
most is a note of anxiety in them from the
first, &#8220;some consequence yet hanging in
the stars,&#8221; which gave warning of their
futile issue. As I read them one after another,
the feeling that they were mine, a
real part of my life, written to me and by
me, became inexplicably remote. I could
not assure myself that they were anything
more than some broken memory of &#8220;old,
unhappy, far-off things,&#8221; a single, sobbing
note of love&#8217;s tragic song that has been
singing in the world from the beginning.
Our tale has been made one with the ancient
theme of the poets. I ask myself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
why love, the one sweet reality of life,
should have been turned for men into the
well-spring of sorrows&mdash;for out of it, in
one way or another, whether through gratification
or disappointment, sorrow does inevitably
flow. Has some jealous power of
fate or the gods willed that man shall live
in eternal deceptions, and so fenced about
with cares and dumb griefs and many madnesses
this great reality and dispeller of
illusion?</p>
<p>And thus from a brief dream of love I
slip back into encircling shadows. I move
among men once more with no certainty
that I am not absolutely alone. Even the
passion I have felt becomes unreal as if
enacted in the dim past. And that is the
torture of it,&mdash;the torture of a man in a
wide sea who beholds the one spar that
was to rescue him drifting beyond his
reach, beyond his vision. Ah, sweet Jessica,
if only I could understand your grief
so that in sympathy I might forget my
own! But it all seems to me so unnecessary&mdash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
we should be sacrificed for the
religious caprice of a frantic old man.
From the first there was a foreboding of
evil in my heart, but I did not look to see
it from this source. I feared always that
the remoteness of my character, which
seemed to terrify you with a sense of unapproachable
strangeness, might keep you
from responding to my passion. But that
passed away. Then came your opposition
to my crusade against the sentimentalism
of the day. That I knew was merely a
new phase of the earlier antipathy, a feeling
that there was no room in my breast
for the ordinary affections and familiarities
of life, a suspicion that my true interests
were set apart from human intercourse.
This, too, passed away, and in its place
came love. And now love is shut out by
the religious caprice of one who dwells in
an intellectual atmosphere which I supposed
had vanished from the world twenty
years ago. I had not imagined that the
institutes of Calvin were still a serious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
matter. I have at least learned something;
and while writing against the lack of faith in
the present religion of humanity, I shall at
least remember that my own calamity has
come from one inured in the old dogma.
It is the irony of Fate that warns us to be
humble.</p>
<p>And so it is ended. I fold away the
little packet of letters with their foolish
outcry of emotion, and on their wrapper
inscribe the words that have been oftenest
on my lips since I grew up to years of
reflection: <i>Dabit deus his quoque finem</i>&mdash;God
will give an end to these things also.

</div>

<p>May the Weird Sisters preserve me from
another such experience! I was walking in
the Park in the evening, and the first warm
odours of spring floating up from the earth
troubled me with a feeling of vague unrest.
Some jarring dissonance between the death
in my heart and the new promise of life all
about me ran along my nerves and set them
palpitating harshly. Then I came upon a
pair of lovers lingering in the shadow of a
tree, holding to each other with outstretched
hands. As I approached them I saw the
woman was weeping quietly. There was
no outcry; no kiss even passed between
them; only a long gaze, a quivering of
the hands, and he was gone. I saw the
woman stand a moment looking hungrily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
after him and then walk away still weeping.
And the sight stung me with madness.
What is the meaning of these endless
meetings and partings&mdash;meeting and parting
till the last great separation comes and
then no more? Are our lives no better
than glinting pebbles that are tossed on the
beach and never rest? Suddenly the blood
surged up into my head. It was as if all
the forces of my physical being had concentrated
into one frenzied desire to possess
the thing I loved. For a moment I
reeled as if smitten with a stroke, and then
without reasoning, scarcely knowing what
I did, started into a stumbling run. Only
the evident amazement of the strollers on
the Avenue when I left the Park brought
me back partially to my senses, yet the
madness still surged through my veins.
All my philosophy was gone, all my remoteness
from life; I was stung by that
fury that comes to beast and man alike; I
was bewildered by the feeling that my emotions
were no longer my own, but were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
shared by the mob of strangers in the
street. It was the passion of love, pure
and simple, unsophisticated by questioning;
and it had turned my brain. Withal
there ran through me an insane desire to
commit some atrocious crime, to waylay
and strike, to speak words of outrageous
insult. I do verily believe that only the
opportunity was wanting, some chance
conflict of the street or temptation of solitude,
to have changed these demoniac impulses
to action&mdash;I whose most violent
physical achievement has been to cross
over Broadway. It is good that I am home
and the blood has left my brain. What
shall I think of this if I read it ten years
hence?

<p>A wise man of the sect of Simon Magus
has replied to an assault of mine on humanitarianism
by trying to show that in this one
faith of modern days are summed up all
the varying ideals of past ages,&mdash;renunciation,
self-development, religion, chivalry,
humanism, pantheistic return to nature,
liberty. Ah, my dear sir, I envy you your
easy, kindly vision. Indeed, all these do
persist in a dim groping way, empty
echoes of great words that have been, bare
shadows without substance. What made
them something more than graceful acts of
materialism was that each and all ended not
in themselves or in worldly accommodation,
but in some purpose outside of human
nature as our humanitarians comprehend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
that nature. Renunciation was practised,
not that my neighbour might have a morsel
more of bread, but that one hungry
soul might turn from the desires of the
flesh to its own purer longings. Self-development
looked to the purging and making
perfect of the bodily faculties, that within
the chamber of a man&#8217;s own breast might
dwell in sweet serenity the eternal spirit of
beauty and joy. Even humanism, which
by its name would seem to be brother to
its present-day parody, perceived an ideal
far above the vicious circle in which humanitarianism
gyrates. My dear foe might
read Castiglione&#8217;s book of <i>The Courtier</i> and
learn how high the Platonic ideal of the
better humanists floated above the charitable
mockery of its name to-day. As for
religion&mdash;go to almost any church in the
land and hear what exhortations flow from
the pulpit. The intellectual contention of
dogmas is forgotten&mdash;and better so, possibly.
But more than that: for one word on
the spirit or on the way and necessity of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
the soul&#8217;s individual growth, you will hear
a thousand on the means of bettering the
condition of the poor; for one word on the
personal relation of man to his God, you
will hear a thousand on the duties of man
to man. Woe unto you, preachers of a
base creed, hypocrites! These things ought
ye to have done, and not to leave the other
undone! You have betrayed the faith and
forgotten your high charge; you have made
of religion a mingling for this world&#8217;s use
of materialism and altruism, while the
spirit hungers and is not fed. Like your
father of old, that Simon Magus, you have
sought to buy the gift of God with a price;
like Judas Iscariot you have betrayed the
Lord with a kiss of brotherhood! Now
might the Keeper of the Keys cry out to-day
with other meaning:</p>

<p>Reading a foolish book on the Literature
of Indiana (!) and find this sentence on the
first page: &#8220;It is not of so great importance
that a few individuals within a State
shall, from time to time, show talent or
genius, as that the general level of cultivation
in the community shall be continually
raised.&#8221; Whereupon the author proceeds
to glorify the &#8220;general level&#8221; through a
whole volume. Now the noteworthy thing
about this particular sentence is the fact
that it was set down as a mere truism
needing no proof, and that it was no doubt
so accepted by most readers of the book.
In reality the sentiment is so far from a
truism that it would have excited ridicule
in any previous age; it might almost be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
said to contain the fundamental error
which is responsible for the low state of
culture in the country. Unfortunately the
point cannot be profitably argued out,
for it resolves itself at last into a question
of taste. There are those who are
chiefly interested in the life of the intellect
and the imagination. They measure
the value of a civilisation by the kind of
imaginative and intellectual energy it displays,
by its top growth in other words.
They crave to see life express itself thus,
<i>sub specie &oelig;ernitatis</i>, and apart from this
conversion of human energy and emotion
into enduring forms they perceive in the
weltering procession of transient human
lives no more significance or value than in
the endless fluctuation of the waves of the
sea. For them, therefore, the creation of
one masterpiece of genius has more meaning
than the physical or mental welfare of
a whole generation; they can, indeed, discern
no genuine intellectual welfare of a
people except in so far as the people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
look up reverently to the products of the
higher imagination. There are others for
whom this life of the imagination has
only a lukewarm interest, for the reason
that their own faculties are weak and
stunted. Naturally they think it a slight
matter whether genius appear to create
what they and their kind can only dimly enjoy;
on the contrary, they hold it of prime
importance that material welfare and the
form of mental cunning which subdues
material forces should be widely diffused
among the people.</p>
<p>Now no one would say a word against
raising &#8220;the general level of cultivation&#8221;;
the higher it is raised the better. Only the
cherishing of this ideal becomes pernicious
when it is made more sacred than the
appearance of individual genius. Nor is it
proper to say that the appearance of genius
is itself contingent on the level of cultivation.
There is much confusion of thought here.
The influence of the people on literature is
invariably attended with danger. It has its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
element of good, for the people cherish
those instinctive passions and notions of
morality which keep art from falling into
artificiality. But refinement, distinction,
form, spirituality&mdash;all that makes of art a
transcript of life <i>sub specie &oelig;ernitatis</i>&mdash;are
commonly opposed to the popular interest
and are even distrusted by the people. The
attitude of the Elizabethan playwrights
toward their audiences gives food for reflection
on this head. Just so sure as the
ideal of general cultivation is made paramount,
just so sure will the higher culture
become degraded to this consideration, and
with its degradation the general cultivation
itself will grow base and material.

<p>I lead a strange dual existence, the intensity
of whose contrast is almost uncanny.
After sitting for hours at my desk
working on my History of Humanitarianism,
I throw myself wearily on the sofa
and smoke. And as the grey fumes float
above my face, slowly they lay a spell
upon me like the waving of mesmeric
hands. I lose consciousness of the objects
about me, the very walls dissolve away in
a mist, and I am lifted as it were on softly
beating pinions and borne swift and far
like a bird. The sensation is curiously
familiar and unfamiliar at the same time,
yet it never causes me surprise. Sometimes
I am carried out into the wide sky
and soar as it seems for hours without ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
alighting, until I am brought to myself with
a sense of rapid falling. At other times I
am borne to the blessed forest where my
love walks, and always then the same
thing happens. I know not whether it is
my spirit or some emanation of my body,
but, however it is, I am there always pursuing
her as once I did in reality, until at
last I lay hold of her and draw her into my
arms beneath that ancient oak. I kiss her
once and twice and a third time, gazing the
while into her startled eyes. Then an inexpressible
sweetness takes possession of
me, a shudder runs through my veins, and
of a sudden all is dark; I am sinking down,
down, in unfathomable abysses, until abruptly
I awake. No words can convey
the mingled reality and remoteness of
these sensations. Jessica, Jessica, you have
troubled the very sources of my being; you
have abandoned me to contend with shadows
and the fear of shadows.

<p>Humanitarians are divided into two classes&mdash;those
who have no imagination, and
those who have a perverted imagination.
The first are the sentimentalists; their brains
are flaccid, lumpish like dough, and without
grip on reality. They are haunted by
the vague pathos of humanity, and, being
unable to visualise human life as it is actually
or ideally, they surrender themselves
to indiscriminate pity, doing a little good
thereby and a vast deal of harm. The
second class includes the theoretical socialists
and other regenerators of society whose
imagination has been perverted by crude
vapours and false visions. They are ignorant
of the real springs of human action;
they have wilfully turned their faces away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
from the truth as it exists, and their punishment
is to dwell in a fantastic dream of
their own creating which works a madness
in the brain. They are to-day what the
religious fanatics were in the Middle Ages,
having merely substituted a paradise on
this earth for the old paradise in the
heavens. They are as cruel and intolerant
as the inquisitors, though they mask themselves
in formulæ of universal brotherhood.

<p>I have been reading too much in this
tattered old note-book of O&#8217;Meara&#8217;s. It is
my constant companion these widowed
days, and the mystic vapour that exhales
from his thought has gone to my head like
opium. I must get rid of the obsession
by publishing the book as a psychological
document or by destroying it once for all.
With its quotations and original reflections
it alternates from page to page between the
sullen despair of a man who has hoped too
often in vain and a rare form of inverted
exaltation. As with me, it was apparently
his custom, when the loneliness of fate oppressed
him, to go out and wander up and
down Broadway, seeking the regions by
night or day where the people thronged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
most busily and steeping his fancy in the
turmoil of its illusion. I can see his ill-clad
figure with bowed head moving slowly
amid the jostling multitude, and I smile to
think how surprised the brave folk would
be, who passed him as he shuffled along
and who no doubt drew their skirts away
lest they should be polluted by rubbing
against him, if they could hear some of the
meditations in his book and learn the pride
of this despised tramp. Many times he
repeats the proverb: <i>Rem carendo non fruendo
cognoscimus</i>&mdash;By losing not by enjoying
the world we make it ours. Out of
the utter ruin and abandonment of his life
he seems to have won for himself a spiritual
possession akin to that of the saints, only
inverted as it were. The impersonal detachment
they gained by rising above human
affairs, he found by sinking below
them. He looked upon the world as one
absolutely set apart from it, and through
that isolation attained a strange insight into
its significance, and even a kind of intoxicating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
joy. On me in my state of bewildered
loneliness his mood exerts an alarming
fascination. It is dangerous to surrender
one&#8217;s self too submissively to this perception
of universal illusion unless a strong
will is present or some master passion as a
guide; for without these the brain is dizzied,
and barely does a man escape the temptation
to throw away all effort and sink
gradually into the stupor of indifference or
something worse. I have felt the madness
creep upon me too often of late and I am
afraid. Ah, Jessica, in withdrawing the
hope of your blessing from me you know
not into what perils of blank indifference
you have cast my soul. Shall I drift away
into the hideous nightmare that pursued
O&#8217;Meara? I will seal up his book, and
make strong my determination to work and
in work achieve my own destiny.

</div>

<p>It seems very lonesome in the big city
without you, little Jack, and often I wish
that some of this pile of books around me
were carried away and you were brought
back to me in their place. But it is better
for you where you are.</p>
<p>You must listen to everything Miss Jessica
tells you about the trees and birds, and
learn to love all the beautiful things growing
around you. I remember there were
four or five great trees in my father&#8217;s garden
when I was a boy living in the country,
and I loved them, each in a different way,
and had names for them and talked to them.
One was an oak tree that grew up almost to
the clouds, and its boughs stood out stiff
and square as if nothing could bend them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
That was the tree I went to when I had
some hard task to do and wanted strength.
Another was an elm that always whispered
comfort to me when I was in trouble. I
used to go to it as some boys run to their
mother, for I grew up like you without
a mother&#8217;s love, and I did not even have
any sweet lady like Miss Jessica to be fond
of me. You must ask Miss Jessica to teach
you all she knows about the trees in Morningtown,
and you must listen to what she
says to them. Perhaps she will tell you
about the famous oaks that grew in a place
called Dodona, and were wiser than any
man or woman in the world. People used
to talk with them as Miss Jessica does
with her favourite tree.</p>
<p>And now, dear Jack, I am going to tell
you a story which I have made up just for
you. It isn&#8217;t about trees exactly, but it all
took place in a deep forest that spread
around a wonderful city. From the high
white walls of the town one could look out
over the green tops of the trees as you look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
down on the grass, and that was a marvellous
sight. There was a single road that
ran through the forest right up to the gate
of the city; but it was a hard road to travel,
dark most of the time because the sun
could not shine through the leaves, and
very lonely, and so still that you could hear
your heart beat except when the winds
blew, and then sometimes the boughs
clashed together overhead and roared and
moaned until you longed for the silence
again. It was a long road too, and the
men who walked through the forest to
the city all had great packs on their shoulders.
And what do you suppose was in
their packs? Why, every traveller carried
with him a gorgeous suit of clothes heavy
with velvet and gold and silver; for so the
people dressed in the beautiful city, and no
one could enter the gate unless he too bore
with him the royal robes. But you see,
while they were walking in the rough forest,
they wore their old clothes of course.</p>
<p>Now in one place a wonderful woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
sat by the roadside. She was a maga, or
witch, named Simona. She was beautiful
if you did not see her too close, with large
round eyes that looked very gentle and
kind. And when any traveller came by,
the big tears would begin to roll down
her cheeks and she would cry out to him
as if she pitied him and wanted to help
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear traveller,&#8221; she would say, &#8220;why
do you trudge along this gloomy road, and
why do you carry that bundle which bends
your shoulders and tires your back? Don&#8217;t
you know that it is all a lie about the
city you are seeking? There is no city
of palaces at your journey&#8217;s end. Indeed,
you will never get to the end of the woods,
but will walk on and on, stumbling and
falling, and growing weaker and weaker,
until at last you fall and never rise. And
the wild beasts that you hear at night
howling in the bushes will rend and
gnaw your body until only your bones are
left.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>At this the travellers would stop and say:
&#8220;But what shall we do, wise witch, and
whither shall we go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she would say to them: &#8220;Turn
aside by this pleasant path, and in a little
while you will come to my beautiful garden
which is named Philanthropia. There
you will find many others whom I have
wept for and saved as I do you; and there
amid the open glades you may live with
them in everlasting peace and love. Houses
are there which you need only to enter and
call your own. And when you are hungry
you have only to speak, and immediately
all that you desire to eat will appear on the
tables. And when you are tired, soft beds
will rise up to receive you. And clothes
will be spread before you&mdash;not stiff and
uncomfortable robes like those you carry
in your pack, but soft garments suited to
that land of comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the travellers believed the witch
and turned into the by-path. But, alas! it
was soon worse for them than it had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
on the road; for they were led, not to a
garden, but into a great sandy desert, where
nothing grew and no rain or dew ever fell.
And somehow they could find no way out
of the desert, but wandered to and fro in
the endless fields of dust, while the hot
sun beat upon their heads and their hearts
failed them for hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>But now and then a wary traveller did
not believe the witch and laughed at her
tears and soft voice. And then, unless
he got away very quick, something dreadful
happened to him. The witch suddenly
changed into a huge monster with a hundred
flaming eyes, and a hundred mouths
with which she raved and bellowed, and a
hundred long arms that coiled about like
serpents. She was so terrible that most
men who saw her in her true form fell
down fainting at her feet; and these she
lifted up and threw into deep dark holes,
hidden from the road, where the poor
wretches soon died of sheer loneliness.</p>
<p>And now comes the heart of the story,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
dear Jack, if you are not too tired to read to
the end.</p>
<p>One day a knight and a lady came riding
up the road. The knight was not very
strong, nor was his armour much to look
at,&mdash;just an ordinary knight, but he was
brave, and there was a mighty determination
in his heart to slay the false, wicked
witch whose deeds he had heard of. And
as he rode he turned often to look into his
lady&#8217;s eyes, and always he seemed to drink
new courage from those clear pools, as a
thirsty man drinks refreshment from a well
of cool water, for the lady was young and
passing fair&mdash;as fair as Miss Jessica, and
she, you know, is the loveliest woman in
all the world. And so at last they came to
where the witch was sitting and weeping.
Without a word the knight drew his
sword and rushed upon her. Of course
she changed instantly to the monster with
the hundred eyes and mouths and arms.
The air was filled with the fire from her
eyes and with the dreadful bellowing from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
her mouths, and her arms swung frantically
about on every side to seize the knight and
crush him. But this was the strange thing
about the battle: as often as the knight
looked at the lady, who stood near him,
he gained new strength and the witch
could not harm him.</p>
<p>He was cutting off her arms one by one
and victory was almost his, when down
the road came an old man wagging his
grey beard dolefully and muttering into his
breast. And when he reached the three
there at the roadside, he stood for a moment
watching the battle and still muttering
in his beard. Then without a word
he beckoned to the lady. She hesitated,
sighed, and turned away, leaving the poor
knight to struggle alone without the blessing
of her eyes. And immediately his
strength seemed to abandon him and his
sword dropped at his side. You may be
sure the witch shouted with triumph at
this, and the noise of her bellowing sounded
like the clanging of a hundred discordant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
bells. It was almost over with the knight.
But suddenly he too uttered a great cry.
Despair came to give him strength where
hope had been before. &#8220;For love and
the world!&#8221; he cried out and drove at the
monster once again with his uplifted sword.</p>
<p>And, dear Jack, do you wish to know
how the battle ended? I am very, very
sorry, but I can&#8217;t tell you, for when I came
through the forest the knight and the witch
were still fighting. There was a look of
desperate determination in the knight&#8217;s
eyes, but, to tell you the truth, I think
his heart was with the lady who had left
him, and it is not easy to fight without a
heart in this world, you know.</p>
<p>Write to me soon, a long, long letter
and tell me about the trees of Morningtown.
Some day when you are grown
up and live with men, you will be glad
to remember the friendship and the wise

<p>A wan beggar, seated on the coping that
surrounds St. Paul&#8217;s and exploiting his
misery before the world. A strange scene
calculated to give one pause,&mdash;the poor
waif crying his distress on the curb,
within the iron fence the ancient sleeping
dead, and along the thoroughfare of Broadway
the ceaseless unheeding stream of
humanity. As I walked up the street with
this image in my mind, the lines of an old
Oriental poem kept time with my steps
until I had converted them into English:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>I heard a poor man in the grave-yard cry:</p>

<p>I am reminded of that joke, rather grim
forsooth, which Lowell thought the best
ever made. It is in <i>The Frogs</i> of Aristophanes.
The god Dionysus and his slave
Xanthias are travelling the road to Hades,
the slave as a matter of course carrying
the pack for the two. They meet a procession
bearing a corpse to the tomb.
Xanthias begs the dead man to take the
pack with him as he is borne so comfortably
on the same road to the nether world.
Whereupon they dicker over the portage.
&#8220;Two shillings for the job,&#8221; says the
corpse, sitting up on his bier. &#8220;Too
much,&#8221; says Xanthias. &#8220;Two shillings,&#8221;
insists the corpse. &#8220;One and sixpence,&#8221;
cries Xanthias. &#8220;<i>I&#8217;d see myself alive
first</i>!&#8221; says the corpse, sinking down
on the bier.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mr. Towers</span>:</p>
<p>The young lady have the letter you wrote
me and I cant get it. But you needent
bother about writing any more tales. I
guess you done the best you could, but
we dont neither one like what you told
about the witch and them young people
in the forest. Why do the knight stand
there fighting the witch when the old man
have run off with his girl? Why dont he
take out after them and leave the witch
to bleed to death? And the young lady
thinks of it worse than I do. She went on
awful when she read it, and cried. I guess
she was sorry about the way the knight
kept on cutting off that woman&#8217;s legs and
arms even if she was bad. She don&#8217;t say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
nothing else nice about you now, nor let
me. But she says you are the crewelest
man she have known. And she cries a
heap when there aint nothing the matter,
and blames at every thing. The old gentleman
feels bad about it but he dont know
what to do. I guess now he wishes he
hadent fooled with the young lady&#8217;s salvation
none. Because she have told him one
day when he was trying to talk pious at
her, not to say nothing, that she dident
believe in nothing now but damnation.
And he say &#8220;Dont talk that way before
the child.&#8221; But I aint come to neither
one of them things yet.</p>

<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>PHILIP TO JACK</p>
</div>

<p>I am afraid, little Jack, that my long
story about the lady and the knight in
the woods did not interest you very much;
and that is a pity, for, if I cannot amuse
you, how shall I do when I come to write
stories for grown-up folk? Well, anyway,
I am going to tell you what happened after
the lady and the old man went away into
the forest.</p>
<p>For awhile they walked side by side in
silence. But the road was long and it was
already late, and by and by the night fell and
wrapped all the trees in solemn shadows.
It was not easy to keep the path in the
darkness, and pretty soon they were quite
lost and found themselves wandering helplessly
in the black tangled aisles of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
forest. That was bad, for the lady was
tired in body and discomforted in heart.
But worse happened when the old man
left her to seek out the path alone, for he
only lost himself more completely in the
treacherous shadows and could not get
back to her. Ah, Jack, if the lady was
beautiful when the sunlight shone upon
her, how lovely do you suppose she was
here in the night with the white beams of
the moon sifting down through the swaying
boughs upon her blanched face? But
her beauty merely frightened her the more
in her terrible loneliness, where the only
sound she heard was the stealthy whisperings
of the breeze among the leaves, as
if all the shadows up yonder were weaving
some plot against her, while at times
a low inarticulate moan or some sudden
crackling of dry twigs floated to her out
of the impenetrable gloom of the forest.
At last she threw herself on her face under
a great tree, and wept and wept for very
terror and loneliness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>Now wonderful things may happen in
the night, dear Jack. The trees then have
a life of their own, and sometimes when
the sun, which belongs to man only, is
gone they have power to do what they
please to foolish people who come into
their circle. And so this tree that stood
leaning over the prostrate lady whispered
and whispered to itself in a strange language.
Then out of the boughs there came
creeping a dark cold shadow. It dropped
down noiselessly to the ground and covered
the lady all about. It moved and
swayed in the faint moonlight like a column
of wind-blown smoke. You will
hardly believe the rest, but it seemed slowly
to take the very shape of the lady herself,
as if it were her own shadow that had
found her; and so it began to creep into
her body. And as it melted into her flesh,
she grew cold and ever colder as if her
blood were turning to ice. Pretty soon it
would have reached her heart and then&mdash;I
shudder to think what would have become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
of her. But when the first chill
touched her heart, she uttered a loud cry
of fear: &#8220;Dear knight, dear knight,&#8221; she
called out, &#8220;where are you? Save me!
save me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then another wonderful thing happened
in the darkness, for at such times our spoken
words may take on a life of their own
just as the trees and shadows do. And so
these words of the lady, instead of scattering
in the air, were changed into a marvellous
little fairy elf that went stealing
away through the forest. And as the elf
ran swiftly under the trees and over the
long grass, so lightly indeed that the
flowers and weeds only bowed under his
feet as when a gentle breeze passes over
them,&mdash;as the elf sped on, I say, everywhere
the earth sent up a lisping whisper,
&#8220;Save me, dear knight! save me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the knight was far away, resting
from his battle with the old witch. He
had wounded her in many places, and
might perhaps have killed her, had not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
sly wicked creature suddenly slipt away
from him into some hiding place of hers
in the desert. And so, as he could not
reach her, he was resting, very tired and
very sad. Then suddenly, as he sat with
his head hanging down, the little elf came
tripping over the grass and plucked him
by the arm, and the faint whisper stole into
his ear, &#8220;Save me, dear knight! save me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you suppose he was long in rising
and following the clever little elf back to
their mistress? Ah, Jack, there was a
happy hour and a happy year and a blissful
life for the lady and her knight then,
was there not?</p>
<p>And now, Jack, I will not bother you
with any more stories after this. Write to
me and tell me all you are doing. Be
good, little Jack, and listen to the wise
words of the trees and other growing
things; and, above all, love that sweet
lady, Miss Jessica.</p>

<p>There are two paths of consolation and
we have strayed from both. There is the
way of the <i>Imitation</i> trod by those who
have perceived the illusion of this life and
the reality of the spirit,&mdash;the way over
whose entrance stand written the words:
&#8220;The more nearly a man approacheth unto
God, the further doth he recede from all
earthly solace.&#8221; And truly he who hath
boldly entered on this path shall be free
in heart, neither shall shadows trample
him down&mdash;<i>tenebr&oelig; non conculcabunt te</i>.
There is also that other way pointed out
by Pindar to the Greek world in his Hymns
of Victory,&mdash;the way of honour and glory,
of seeking the sweet things of the day
without grasping after the impossible, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
joys temperate withal yet gilded with the
golden light of song; the way of the strong
will and clear judgment and purged imagination,
with reverence for the destiny
that is hereafter to be; of the man who is
proudly sufficient unto himself yet modest
before the gods; the way summed up by
a rival of Pindar&#8217;s in the phrase: &#8220;Doing
righteousness, make glad your heart!&#8221;
There is not much room for pity here or in
the <i>Imitation</i>, for compassion after all is a
perilous guest, and only too often drags
down a man to the level of that which he
pities.</p>
<p>And now instead of these twin paths of
responsibility to God and to a man&#8217;s own
self, we have sought out another way&mdash;the
way of all-levelling human sympathy, the
way celebrated by Edwin Markham! Oh,
if it were possible to cry out on the street
corners where all men might hear and
know that there is no salvation for literature
and art, no hope for the harvest of the
higher life, no joy or meaning in our civilisation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
until we learn to distinguish between
the manly sentiment of such work
as Millet&#8217;s painting and the mawkishness
of such a poem as <i>The Man with the Hoe</i>!
The one is the vigorous creation of a craftsman
who builded his art with noble restraint
on the great achievements of the
past, and who respected himself and the
material he worked in; the other is the disturbing
cry of one who is intellectually an
hysterical parvenu.

<p>The new volumes of Letters have carried
me back to Carlyle, who has always rather
repelled me by his noisy voluminousness.
But one message at least he had to proclaim
to the world,&mdash;the ancient imperishable
truth that man lives, not by surrender
of himself to his kind, but by following the
stern call of duty to his own soul. Do thy
work and be at peace. Make thyself right
and the world will take care of itself.
There lies the everlasting verity we are
rapidly forgetting. And he saw, too, as
no one to-day seems to perceive, the intimate
connection between the preaching
of false reform and the gripe of a sordid
plutocracy. He saw that most reformers,
by presenting materialism to the world in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
the disguise of a sham ideal, were really
playing into the hands of those who find
in the accumulation of riches the only aim
of life, that they are in fact one of the chief
obstacles in the path of any genuine reformation.
The humanitarianism that attains
its utterance in Mr. Markham&#8217;s rhapsodic
verse loses sight of judgment in its cry for
justice. It ceases to judge in accordance
with the virtue and efficiency of character,
and seeks to relieve mankind by a false
sympathy. Such pity merely degrades by
obscuring the sense of personal responsibility.
From it can grow only weakness
and in the end certain decay.

<p><i>Finivi</i>. The last word of my <i>History of
Humanitarianism</i> is written, and it only
remains now to see this labour of months&mdash;of
years, rather&mdash;through the press. I
know not what your fate will be, little
book, in this heedless, multitudinous-hurried
world; I know but this, that I have
spoken a true word as it has been given
me to see the truth. That any great result
will come of it, I dare not expect. Only I
pray that, if the message falls unregarded,
it will be because, as she said, my bells
ring too high, and not for want of veracity
and courage in the utterance. After all it
is good to remember the brave words of
William Penn to his friend Sydney: &#8220;Thou
hast embarked thyself with them that seek,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
and love, and choose the best things; and
number is not weight with thee.&#8221; I have
tried to show how from one ideal to another
mankind has passed to this present
sham ideal, or no-ideal, wherein it welters
as in a sea of boundless sentimentalism. I
have tried to show that because men to-day
have no vision beyond material comfort
and the science of material things&mdash;that
for this reason their aims and actions are
divided between the sickly sympathies of
Hull House and the sordid cruelties of
Wall Street. And I have written that the
only true service to mankind in this hour
is to rid one&#8217;s self once for all of the canting
unreason of &#8220;equality and brotherhood,&#8221;
to rise above the coils of material
getting, and to make noble and beautiful
and free one&#8217;s own life. Sodom would
have been saved had the angel of the Lord
found therein only ten righteous men, and
our hope to-day depends primarily, not on
the elevation of the masses (though this
too were desirable), but on the ability of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
few men to hold fast the ancient truth and
hand it down to those who come after.
So shall beauty and high thought not perish
from the earth&mdash;&#8220;Doing righteousness,
make glad your heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>And for my own sake it is good that the
work is finished. It has overmastered my
understanding too long and caused me to
judge all things by their relation to this
one truth or untruth. It has debarred me
from that <i>sereine contemplation de l&#8217;univers</i>,
wherein my peace and better growth
were found. I am free once again to look
upon things as they are in themselves.

<p>I went yesterday afternoon to see the
Warren collection of pictures which has
been sent here for sale at auction, and one
little landscape impressed me so deeply
that all last night in my dreams I seemed
to be walking unaccompanied in the waste
places of the artist&#8217;s vision. It was a picture
by Rousseau; a <i>Sunset</i> it was called,
though something in the wide look of expectancy
and the purity of the light reminded
me more of early dawn than of
evening; one waited before it for the unfolding
of a great event. A flat, marshy
land stretched back to the horizon, where it
blended almost indistinguishably into the
grey curtain of the sky. A deserted road
wound into the distance, passing at one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
spot a low boulder and farther on a little
expanse of dark water, and vanishing
then into the far-off heavens. Overhead,
through the level clouds, the light pierced
at intervals, wan and cold, save near the
horizon where a single spot of crimson gave
hint of the rising or the setting sun. There
lay over the whole a sense of inexpressible
desertion, as if it were almost a trespass
for the human eye to intrude upon the
scene&mdash;as if some sacred powers of the
hidden world had withdrawn hither for
the accomplishment of a solemn mystery.
As I stood before it, a great emotion broke
over me, a feeling of extraordinary expansion,
like that which comes to one in a
close room when a broad window is
thrown suddenly open to the fresh air and
to far-vanishing vistas. I know little or
nothing of the artist&#8217;s life, but I am sure
that he had looked upon this desert scene
with the same emotion of enlargement as
mine, only far greater and purer. And I
know that his heart in its loneliness had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
comprehended the infinite solitudes of nature
and through that act of comprehension
was lifted up with a strange and austere
exultation. For, gazing upon these wide
silences, he learned that the indignities and
conflicts and weary ambitions of life meant
little to him, as the storms and tumultuous
forces of the earth mean nothing to the
heart of Nature, and in that lesson was his
peace. One concern only was his,&mdash;to
wrest from the impenetrable mystery of
the world an image of everlasting beauty,
and to set forth this image to others whose
vision was not yet purged of trouble.

<p>I can rest no more to-night, for I have
been visited by strange dreams. It seemed
to me in my sleep that I wandered desolate
in a desolate land&mdash;not in wide waste
places as I dreamed after seeing Rousseau&#8217;s
picture, but in some wilderness of trees
where the light from a thin moon drifted
rarely through the slow-waving boughs.
And always as I wandered, I knew that
somewhere afar off in that dim forest my
beloved whom I had deserted lay in an
agony of suspense, waiting for me and
calling to me through the night. It seemed
almost as if the years of a lifetime passed,
and still I sought and could not find her&mdash;only
shadows met me and fantastic shapes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
out of the darkness greeted me with staring
eyes. And, oh, I thought, if this long
agony of solitude troubles her heart as it
troubles mine and she perish in fear because
I have forsaken her! My distress
grew to be more than I could bear. And
then in a loud voice I cried to her: &#8220;Fear
not, beloved; be at peace until I come!&#8221;
I think I must actually have called out in
my sleep, for I awoke suddenly and started
up with the sound still ringing in my ears.
Ah, Jessica, Jessica, what have I done!
My own misery has lain so heavily upon me
that it has not occurred to me to imagine
what you too must have suffered. Indeed,
the wonder of your love has been to me so
incomprehensibly sweet that the notion of
any actual suffering on your part has never
really entered my thought. My own need
I understood&mdash;can it be that our separation
has caused the same weary emptiness in
your days that has made the word peace
a mockery to me? Can it even be that
while I have sought refuge and a kind of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
forgetfulness in the domination of my work,
you have been left a prey to unrelieved
despondency? You accused me once of
conscientious selfishness&mdash;have I made you
a victim of that sin? Idle questions all,
for I have come to a great awakening and
a sure determination. Dear Jessica, it was
this very day one year ago that you walked
into my office, bringing with you hope and
joy like the scent of fresh flowers on the
breath of summer&mdash;making as it were a dayspring
within my sombre life more filled
with glorious promise than the dawn that
even now begins to break against my windows.
It was doubtless the half-conscious
recollection of this anniversary that troubled
my dream&mdash;dream I call it, and yet there is
a conviction strong upon me that somehow
my spirit, or some emanation of my spirit,
was actually abroad this night seeking
yours, that somehow, when I cried aloud,
the sound of my voice penetrated to you
through the darkness and distance. Be at
peace, beloved; for this rising sun shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
not set until I am with you; and no power
of fanaticism, nor any brooding phantasy of
mine, shall ever draw us apart. Fear not,
beloved; be at peace till I come.

<p>I need not tell you that I read the letters
to me which you wrote to Jack. But the
sequel of your story is wrong, dear knight.
After a long famine, out of a very wilderness
of sorrows, it is I who return to you.
And I wonder if you will recognise in the
poor little bedraggled vixen that I now am,
the gay lady dryad with whom you walked
that day in the forest when we met the
witch. You may be shocked to learn, however,
that I hold you more than half accountable
for the misfortunes that have
befallen me since! You should have saved
<i>me</i> instead of attempting to slay the witch.
But you allowed me to depart, a dejected
fiction of filial piety, to become the victim
of a fanatical father&#8217;s ethics. Why did you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
consent to this sacrilege? For, indeed, I
hold it as much a sacrilege to change a
Jessica into a deaconess as it would be to
turn a Christian into a Hottentot,&mdash;provided
either were possible.</p>
<p>I admit that it was I who ended our
engagement and forbade you to come here;
but that was only a part of <i>my</i> delusion,
not <i>yours</i>! But why did you not rescue
me from these delusions? Are they not
more terrible than the beasts at Ephesus?
Really I know not which of us has showed
less wisdom,&mdash;you who stayed to slay a
metaphorical witch created of your own
heated imagination, or I, with all my hopes
unfulfilled, turning aside to follow one whose
prophecies carry him out of the world rather
than into it. And I do not know what
has been the result of your mistake, but
with me it has been war. I have been like
a small province in rebellion, burning and
slaying all within my borders. I am a
heathen Hittite in father&#8217;s vineyard. I have
profaned all his scriptures and confounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
all his doctrines, until I think now the only
boon he prays for is deliverance.</p>
<p>But one thing I have learned, dear knight
of my heart,&mdash;submitting to a paternal edict
does not change the course of nature, although
true love often runs less smoothly
on that account. You cannot make a wren
out of a redbird, even if you are the God of
both. And not all the prayers in heaven
can save a little white moth from her candle,
once she has felt it shining upon her
wings. Just so, some charm of light in
you, some clear illumination of things that
reaches far beyond all the doctrines I know,
draws me like a destiny. It does not appear
whether I shall live in a gay rhythm
around it or drop dead in the flame, and it
no longer matters. Like the poor moth,
all I know is that I can neither live nor die
apart from it.</p>
<p>And this brings me to the point of telling
you why I have the courage to break my
promise and to write again. I have had
what father calls a &#8220;revelation,&#8221; when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
is about to construe life for me according
to the prayers he has said. But in no
sense does my revelation resemble the
Christian shrewdness of his. It has all the
grace of a heathen oracle, and, father would
say, all the earthly fallacies of one! For,
indeed, my life is so near and kin to Pan&#8217;s
that my vision never goes far beyond the
green edges of this present world. So!
draw near, then, while I tell your fortune
according to the shadows of my own destiny!&mdash;as
near as you were that day when
we read the old Latin poet together under
the trees in our forest,&mdash;for in some ways
your fortune resembles the scriptures of
Catullus. They are dual, and the ethics
they prove are romantic, too, rather than
ascetic.</p>
<p>I have a mind to begin at the beginning
and to run again over the long fairy trail of
our love, so that we may see more clearly
where our good stars agree. And oh,
dear Philip, my heart craves to talk with
you. Silence to you is the rare atmosphere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
where your wings expand and bear you
swiftly upward and ever upward. But I&mdash;I
cannot soar, I cannot breathe in that
silence. I am writing, writing, to save
my heart from the madness of this long
restraint. I am comforting myself with
this story of our love&mdash;until you come,
for you will come, Philip. Well, the beginning
was when a certain poor little
Eve escaped from her garden in the South,
which was not according to the record in
such matters, and brazened her way into
the office of a certain literary editor in New
York. As well as I can remember she
was in search of fame, and she found,&mdash;ah,
dear Heart,&mdash;she found both love and
knowledge. But do you know how terrifying
you are to a primitive original woman
such as I was then? I had nothing
in my whole experience by which to interpret
the broad white silence of the brow
you lifted to greet me, nor the grave knowledge
of your eyes that comprehended me
altogether without once sharpening into a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
penetrating gaze. I had a judgment-day
sensation, through which I did not know
if I should endure! I was divided between
one impulse to flee for my life and the
more natural one to stand and contend for
my secrets. Did you know, dear Philip,
that every woman is born with a secret?
I did not until that revealing day when
first you encompassed me about with the
wisdom of your eyes. Then, all in a moment,
I longed to clasp both hands over
my heart to hide it from you. You talked
by rote of literature, but I could not tell
of what you were really thinking. And
I answered in little frightened chirups, like
a small winged thing that is blown far out
of its course by the gale.</p>
<p>All this happened to me one year ago
to-day, dear Philip. But this year with
you I have come a longer distance than
in all the years of my life before. After
that desperate visit to New York, I returned
to Morningtown, a delightful mystery to
myself, made rich with an unaccountable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
joy, and with an inexplicable rainbow
arched in my heart&#8217;s heavens. I did not
know for what I hoped, but suddenly I
understood that life&#8217;s dearest fulfilment was
before me.</p>
<p>After that I do not know how the charm
of love worked within my heart, only that
I had always the happy animation of some
one newly blessed. And I had the divine
sensation of being recreated, fashioned
for some happier destiny. I lost father&#8217;s
boundary lines of prayer and creed. Some
limitation of my own mind passed away
and I entered into a sort of heathen fellowship
with the very spirits of the air. And
always I thought only of you. The very
reviews I wrote were, in a sense, remote
love letters, foreign prayers to your strange
soul. I even banished distance by some
miracle of love and often sat in spirit
upon the perilous ledge of your window
sill.</p>
<p>This feat was not so easy to do at first,
for I was much afraid of you. Your mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
seemed alien to me in the anti-humanitarian
attitude which you assumed to life. Yet
it was this very power in you to surpass
in philosophy all mere mortal conditions
that fascinated my attention, compelled my
allegiance. And for a long while I stood
in jealous awe of your &#8220;upper chamber.&#8221;
I resented that cold expression of your
spirituality. Then suddenly I was like a
white moth beating my wings against
your high windows.</p>
<p>In those days, Philip, I felt that I could
be forever contented if only I <i>knew</i> that
you loved me, and that your loving included
all the strange altitudes of your
mind. Nor can I ever forget the happiness
I felt in the first assurances of your tenderness.
They seemed to justify and set me
free. I danced many a pagan rhythm
through my forest, and dared every bird
with a song. I had that liberty of being
which comes of perfect peace,&mdash;the same
I have heard father&#8217;s repentant sinners
profess. And I was resolved, oh, so firmly!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
never to compromise it with any sacrifice
of romance to reality.</p>
<p>But, alas! now I know that if a man
loves a woman, this is only the beginning
of a long negotiation, carried forward in
poetic terms; and that his love is a sort
of <i>fi. fa.</i>, which he will some day serve
upon her heart.</p>
<p>Upon your first visit to Morningtown it
was easy to hold out against you, for you
were such a distant, dignified admirer then.
Your apparent diffidence, your natural reserve,
seemed to give me a coquettish
advantage over the situation, and I was
not slow to avail myself of it. How was I
to know there was such a mad lover lying
concealed behind your classic pose? Thus
it was that I compromised all the armies
of my heart. Henceforth I marched madly,
dizzily to my final surrender. I could not
have saved myself if a thousand Blüchers
had hurried to my defence. And there
even came a time when I desired my own
capitulation; a thing which, owing to some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
perversity of nature, I was unable to accomplish
of my own will.</p>
<p>But you will remember how that finally
came about, and it might have come so
much earlier if you had made your first
visit with the same brigand determination
as your second. And you brought Jack
with you! How droll you two looked that
day as you stood upon our narrow door-sill
awaiting your welcome! There was
no accent of paternity in your expression
to justify poor little Jack&#8217;s presence. The
relationship between you seemed so ludicrously
artificial,&mdash;as if you had somehow
got an undeserved iota subscript to your
callous, scholarly heart. The situation put
you at such a humorous disadvantage,
made you appear so at variance with your
hard, uncharitable theories of life, and with
your superlative dignity of mien, that the
terror I had felt in anticipation of your
visit vanished away. I think the awkward
helplessness with which you seemed always
to be trying to domesticate yourself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
to Jack appealed to my sense of humour
so keenly that your romantic proportions
were suddenly reduced. You were less
formidable to deal with as a lover. That
is how I came to consent to the walk
we took in the forest. Ah me! I should
have taken warning from your enigmatical
silence. And indeed I did tremble with
vivacity in my effort to break it. But you
only looked mysteriously confident about
something and kept your own counsel,
giving me a nod or a quizzical smile now
and then, as if what I was saying really
had no bearing whatever upon the issue
at hand.... Then suddenly the grey
wood shadows fell about us. The world
changed back a thousand ages and we
were the only man and woman in it. I
felt the sudden compulsion of your arms
about me. And, Philip, I could have rested
in them if I had not caught in your face
the expression of a new, undisguised man;
but the strange white intensity of it startled
me so that I must have died or made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
my escape. Ah! you do not know how
sincere was my flight from you the next
moment. I knew that I should be captured
at last; but after the divine madness I had
seen in your eyes, I could not be <i>willing</i>.
And when at last you overtook me under
that old Merlin oak, you showed no mercy
at all, my lord. You were not even sorry
for me, and you did not understand as I
lay with my face covered in terror and
shame against your breast. Philip, why
does a woman always weep when the
first man kisses her the first time, no
matter how glad she is? I hope you do
not know enough to answer this question.
But I am sure every woman does weep;
and I think it is because she feels even in
the midst of her great happiness, an irremediable
loss, for which nothing ever fully
atones.</p>
<p>But another question is, How could I,
after being lost to you in this dear way,
turn my face from you at the command of
a religious enthusiast? A regard for father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
and not for his righteousness is the explanation;
for I felt more nearly right following
my heart to you. But now, dear
knight, I am ready to forgive you the fault
of assenting to such an unnatural sacrifice,
if only you will come and take me once
more. At present I am a sorry little vagabond,
very much the worse for wear, owing
to father&#8217;s efforts to sanctify me. But
if you will only love me enough, I think I
could be Jessica again. And perhaps you
have some more natural way of sanctifying
me yourself; for I doubt now if I shall ever
see heaven unless I may ascend through
your portals.</p>
<p>Every day since our bereavement of each
other, I have kept a tryst under our big
tree in the forest. At first this was a tender
formality, a memorial of a happiness
that had passed. But after a time I began
to have a power of mental vision that was
akin to communication. I came out of
myself to meet you somewhere in that
mysterious world of silence to which you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
seem to belong. There were hours when
I felt absolutely certain of your nearness, a
tender peace enfolded me as warm as your
arms are. And I had the supreme satisfaction
of having outwitted all father&#8217;s powers
and principalities. Then came days when
by no sweet incantation could I bring myself
near you. I wept upon my sod like
one forsaken, and grieved the more because
I conceived that you must be far out of my
regions in one of your &#8220;upper chamber&#8221;
moods, where all your faculties were
concentrated upon some merely philosophical
proposition. I wonder now if
you are laughing! If you knew how I
have suffered, you would not even smile.
If you knew how I have <i>needed</i> to be
kissed, you would make haste to come
to me.</p>
<p>I had been making these excursions into
the forest for a long time before I discovered
that Jack was playing the part of
eavesdropping guardian angel. Do you
know, by the way, what a quaint little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
ragamuffin philosopher that child is? He
has a shrewd sobriety, a steady watchfulness
over all about him, and he is endowed
with a power of silent devotion that is absolutely
compelling. He has been such a
comfort to me! and there is no way of
keeping him out of your confidence. He
knows things by some occult science of
loving. Thus I was not offended one day
when I looked up from the shadows under
my oak and saw him regarding me gravely,
almost compassionately, from behind a
neighbouring tree. After this we had a
tacit understanding that he might play
sentinel there when I came into the
forest.</p>
<p>See how much I have said, and still I
have not told you the strangest part of my
story&mdash;the moonlit revelation of you to me.
I am writing, writing, to ease my heart
until you come. And always as I write I
listen for the sound of your dear footsteps.
For many successive days I had found our
trysting place a veritable desert. I seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
to have lost my heart&#8217;s way to you; and
in proportion to my bewilderment, life became
more and more intolerable. I had
the desperate sensation of one who is about
to be lost in a waste land, and I felt that I
could not live through the frightful loneliness
of such an experience. Yesterday
again I failed to find the comfort of your
occult presence when I went into the
wood. I was filled with consternation,
and when the night came I lay tossing in
a sleepless fever. Unless I knew once
more in my heart that you loved me, I felt
that I could no longer endure life. So I lay
far into the night. At last in desperation I
arose from my bed, slipped on my shoes
and the big cloak that you will remember,
and fled away to our tree in the forest,
pursued by a thousand shadows. For indeed
I am usually afraid of the dark; it is
like a silence to me&mdash;your silence, Philip&mdash;and
I fear it because I do not know what
it contains. But I had got one of father&#8217;s
wrestling-Jacob&#8217;s moods upon me by this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
time, and if Mahomet&#8217;s mountain had come
booming by I should not have been deterred
from my purpose. But do you know that
there is more life in a little forest when
darkness falls than in a big town? and
that every living thing there recognises you
as an intruder with warning calls from tree
to tree? I had not more than cast myself
upon the ground to sob out all my griefs to
whatever gods would listen, when a sleepy
little robin just overhead called up to his
mistress the tone of my trouble. The
young leaves whispered it, the boughs
swept low about me, and the winds carried
messages of it away into the heavens, so
that suddenly the whole night knew of my
woe and pitied me.</p>
<p>I know not how long I lay there staring up
at the blue abyss of stars through the grizzly
shades of night. I only know that my face
was wet with tears and that I seemed to
tremble upon the brink of a long life&#8217;s despair.
And oh! Philip I never <i>loved</i> you
so,&mdash;not only with my heart and lips, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
with my soul. And it was my soul that
went out in a prayer to you to come. I
remembered not only the dear ways you
have of folding me into your arms and
making me surpassingly happy, so against
my own will, but I remembered the silent
young sage in his upper chamber, and I
felt that indeed it was to this esoteric personality
that I must pray for help.</p>
<p>And so I gave my soul away to the
sweet silence, and waited. The moonlight
falling down through an open space made
a cataract of tremulous brightness. It edged
all the shadows with a silver whiteness, as
of wings hidden.</p>
<p>And then suddenly there came to me out
of the far abyss above my trees a message,
a sweet assurance. Oh, I know not how
to call to it, only I felt the nearness of my
love. And I was afraid, my darling, and
closed my eyes lest I should <i>see</i> you. And
then, oh, Philip, I felt, I am sure I felt your
face close to mine, and in my ears a low
whisper breathed like the passing of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
breeze, a voice saying: &#8220;Fear not, beloved;
be at peace until I come!&#8221; And I
knew then that you loved me and had not
forsaken me altogether.</p>
<p>And when at last I raised my eyes, I
became aware of the fact that I was still
not alone; and peering through the dim
spaces about me I beheld <i>Jack</i> sitting
hunched up on the root of his tree like a
small toad of fidelity! The little owl
sprite in him never quite slumbers, I think;
and seeing me leave the parsonage, he
had crept out and followed bravely after
through the shadows. But the picture
he made now startled me into a peal of
laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the lady in the story that
was lost,&#8221; said Jack, with the solemn intonation
of one who has himself received a
revelation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I confessed softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But will the knight come to find you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so; I think he is coming now,
dear Jack.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well damn him if he don&#8217;t!&#8221; was
the little wretch&#8217;s impious comment. I
always suspected him capable of using
strong language, but this was the first
time we had met upon a sufficiently intimate
basis of friendship for him to exploit
it.</p>
<p>And now, Philip, that is all until you
come. But hasten, my beloved! I am
already aged with this long waiting for
you. Do not ask me about father. He is
a good shepherd, but I am a small black
sheep determined not to be made white
according to his plan. And he has come
to that place where he would be ready to
take even you as an under-shepherd of this
factious ewe lamb. Besides, could we not
make a providential offering of Jack, as
Abraham did of the goat when he was
about to slay Isaac? Jack, I think, has a
heavenly wit withal, and could adjust the
little prayer light of his soul even to father&#8217;s
high altar mind. As for me, I cannot conceive
of life alone without you one whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
day longer. Indeed, so strong is my premonition
of your approach, that even now I
listen for the sound of your footsteps upon
the gravel outside.</p>
